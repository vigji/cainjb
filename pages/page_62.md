**Annotated text**:
`What should such a man need with such a companion, I asked myself. And then I thought of Jims uncle, Darius Brockley, and of the flimsy excuse the Vicars niece had given when she returned. Yes, I began to understand. And I was not sorry to dissociate the last of the gold from the silver, and wait upon events. I stretched out my hand and touched a dime shape on the chair beside me ; a sleek cat that horribly exulted at the touch of my fingers. We were told that the human heart was deceitful and desperately wicked ; what then should be said of the human mind? Why, I meant, should I have remembered the tale of the Major-General in Trafalgar Square on Guy Fawkes night, and how the dead man had told it me, just an hour before...they came to take him away? And then how about myself? Admittedly I was a warrior, but even I, surely, could be a warrior without being a bounder. `

**Italian text**:
Mi chiesi di cosa potesse avere bisogno un simile
uomo con una simile compagnia. Poi pensai allo zio
di Jim, Darius Brockley, e alla debole scusa accampata
dalla nipote del vicario quando era tornata. Sì,
cominciavo a capire. E, staccando con piacere l'ultimo
pezzetto d'oro dall'argento, rimasi in attesa degli
eventi. Allungai la mano e toccai una forma indistinta
sulla sedia accanto a me ; un gatto agile che gioì
in maniera oscena al tocco delle mie dita. Ci hanno
insegnato che il cuore umano è ingannevole e disperatamente
malvagio ; che si dovrebbe dire allora della
mente umana? Perché mai, volevo dire, avrei dovuto
rammentare la storia del Maggior generale in
Trafalgar Square la notte di Guy Fawkes, e come me
l'aveva raccontata il morto solo un'ora prima . . . che
venissero a portarlo via ? E che dire di me? Per mia
stessa ammissione amavo combattere, ma dì certo
anch'io potevo combattere senza essere una canaglia.

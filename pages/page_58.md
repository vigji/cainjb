**Annotated text**:
`Considering it was my name month, I wasnt having too much luck.` Augustus?

`Henry, though a bit on the spectacular side---to fly the viscera of his third, of the old family lawyer, at his small flagstaff, a little argued the exhibitionist---was sane enough.`

`And this stranger, to judge by the over-vague conversation he began to force on me---different in this from the agriculturist, who had been utterly silent save for the burning question, and the brats who had only uttered mutually---was distinctly nuts.`

`Nuts in May, how Freudian.`

`Be not a Freud ; thy help is near. But was it?`

`Henry was in desperate case, and this other was short-sighted enough not to realise that I should care.`

`The former was stooping over the cooling remains of his fourth---the rash intruding charlady---when there came a horribly official knock at the little blue door.`

`(Was it Inspector Barraclough, or only some stolid-witted local?) But little the latter cared. He went on talking about Browning.`

Considering it was my name month, I wasnt 
having too much luck. Henry, though a bit on 
the spectacular side---to fly the viscera of his 
third, of the old family lawyer, at his small 
flagstaff, a little argued the exhibitionist---was 
sane enough. And this stranger, to judge by the 
over-vague conversation he began to force on 
me---different in this from the agriculturist, 
who had been utterly silent save for the 
burning question, and the brats who had only 
uttered mutually---was distinctly nuts. Nuts in 
May, how Freudian. Be not a Freud ; thy help is 
near. But was it? Henry was in desperate case, 
and this other was short-sighted enough not to 
realise that I should care. The former was 
stooping over the cooling remains of his 
fourth---the rash intruding charlady---when 
there came a horribly official knock at the little

**Italian text**:
Considerando che era il mese da cui prendevo il nome, la fortuna non mi arrideva particolarmente. Henry,
benché avesse un lato un po' spettacolare - far ondeggiare le viscere della sua terza vittima, del vecchio avvocato di famiglia, dall'asta della sua bandierina denotava un certo esibizionismo -, era abbastanza equilibrato. Mentre quell'estraneo, a giudicare dalla conversazione estremamente vaga che cominciò a impormi - in questo diverso dallo Zotico, che era rimasto in silenzio a parte la bruciante domanda, e dai marmocchi che avevano parlato solo tra di loro -, era decisamente pazzo. Com'era quel film? Nuts in
May. Possibile che i pazzi li trovi tutti io? Ne avrebbe paura persino Freud. Non avere paura ; l'aiuto è vicino. Ma lo era davvero? Henry era in trappola e quest'altro era così miope da non capire che avevo a cuore solo la sorte di Henry. Il quale era chino sui resti fumanti della sua quarta vittima - la donna delle pulizie, improvvida invaditrice -, quando dalla por-ticina azzurra giunse l'orribile suono di qualcuno che bussava in maniera ufficiale. (Era l'ispettore Barra-clough oppure solo qualche stolto del posto?) Ma al tizio non interessava. Continuò a parlare di Browning.

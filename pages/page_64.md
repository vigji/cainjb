**Annotated text**:
`Needless to say I didnt know that that was the last day. Afterwards I found it terrible to look back, and realise that I hadnt made the most of it, or rather of all the little things that went to compose it, and the thousands that had gone before.` 

`I heard him read two things about a man and say that he had put in his appearance to-day. The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, one was, in his gullet should have a hook.`

`And the other called him a demure hypocrite or a blockhead. He must first torture his postman, the bait, and make him carry the letters of Bellerophon.`

`But that was too big for me. My people had always owned allegiance to the McLeod of that ilk, among others. But until he told me about it to-day, I never knew that the Great Lexicographer had tasted Lotus with  him.` Samuel Johnson tasted Lotus with  James Boswell in trip to Hebrides in Scotland, there was a McLeod as well.

`There was that in me which needed the exercise of fealty. To give all---as I had given all to him---was very bone of my bone.`

Needless to say I didnt know that that was the 
last day. Afterwards I found it terrible to look 
back, and realise that I hadnt made the most of 
it, or rather of all the little things that went to 
compose it, and the thousands that had gone 
before. I heard him read two things about a 
man and say that he had put in his appearance 
to-day. The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, one 
was, in his gullet should have a hook. And the 
other called him a demure hypocrite or a 
blockhead. He must first torture his postman, 
the bait, and make him carry the letters of 
Bellerophon. But that was too big for me. My 
people had always owned allegiance to the 
McLeod of that ilk, among others. But until he 
told me about it to-day, I never knew that the 
Great Lexicographer had tasted Lotus with 
him. There was that in me which needed the

Inutile dire che non sapevo che quello fosse l'ultimo giorno. In seguito fu terribile guardarmi indietro e rendermi conto di non averlo sfruttato al massimo, o meglio di non aver sfruttato tutte le piccole cose che lo componevano, e le migliaia accadute in preceden-za. Lo sentii leggere un paio di cose a proposito di un uomo e dire che aveva fatto la sua apparizione quel giorno. Quel vecchio crudele, stolido, bisbetico, meriterebbe bene di aver nella gola un amo. E l'altro lo chiamava un modesto ipocrita o uno zuccone. Deve prima torturare il postino, l'esca, e fargli portare le lettere di Bellerofonte. Ma era troppo per me. La mia gente aveva sempre dovuto obbedienza al McLeod di quel clan, tra gli altri. Ma, fino a quando non me lo disse quel giorno, non sapevo che il Grande Lessicografo aveva provato il Loto con lui. Sentivo in me l'esigenza di esercitare la fedelt√†. Dare tutto - come avevo dato tutto a lui - significava dare le ossa dell'ossa mie.

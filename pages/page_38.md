**Annotated text**:
`I was feeling better already, and was glad that a memory, true though dim, had led me to the place. Video meliora proboque ; but I could not, for all my covert glances, see the modelling of the fossettes of the elbows of the woman sitting so near me. Were they, I wondered, like Sonia Gordons, triangular dimples with shadow in them? Poor Sonia Gordon. I pondered on that tragic fortnight at Southend : the pier with its electrical railway, and my cousins rash act, and Sonias lapse. Her temperament was against her. Still you couldnt have an omelette without breaking eggs. And mine was excellent. You would get off with a whole skin, would you? I cried softly, as I stabbed once.`

`And even as I did so, I thought of skinny old Marat in his slipper bath, the nightcap about his forehead, the dim light of the candle, the shadow at the door, the stealthy tread of Charlotte Brone with the undulled blade. There was something wrong.` Charlotte Corday, not Charlotte Bronte

I was feeling better already, and was glad that a 
memory, true though dim, had led me to the 
place. Video meliora proboque ; but I could 
not, for all my covert glances, see the modelling 
of the fossettes of the elbows of the woman 
sitting so near me. Were they, I wondered, like 
Sonia Gordons, triangular dimples with 
shadow in them? Poor Sonia Gordon. I 
pondered on that tragic fortnight at Southend : 
the pier with its electrical railway, and my 
cousins rash act, and Sonias lapse. Her 
temperament was against her. Still you couldnt 
have an omelette without breaking eggs. And 
mine was excellent. You would get off with a 
whole skin, would you? I cried softly, as I 
stabbed once. And even as I did so, I thought of 
skinny old Marat in his slipper bath, the 
nightcap about his forehead, the dim light of 
the candle, the shadow at the door, the stealthy 
tread of Charlotte Bront with the undulled 
blade. There was something wrong.

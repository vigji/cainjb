It was that day my friend Sandy told me he was 
sure he wouldnt sleep all night. There was, of 
course, a difference between us. I couldnt get 
all worked up like that. You see, next day he 
would be allowed to fetch back Lagopus 
Scoticus, whom I knew well, and he hadnt 
been allowed to do that for such a long time. I 
was fond of Sandy and rejoiced with him. But I 
felt, I couldnt help feeling, that there was 
something wrong, something disjoined about 
my very front. I made love to Flora again in the 
back parts ; the result was satisfactory enough. I 
was feeling quite at my best, but I took Bob 
Martin in completely. After all he liked me to, 
and he was always right. But I had come to the 
conclusion that I loathed her ; she kept 
colouring up. I understood why he had once 
said to me about something being as flush as 
May. Also she wore her hair in a cluster of little 
sly curls, a thing which in our family 
emphatically was not done.

**Italian text**:

Fu quel giorno che il mio amico Sandy mi disse di essere certo che non avrebbe dormito per tutta la notte.
Tra noi, come è ovvio, c'era una differenza. Io non potevo emozionarmi come lui. Sapete, il giorno seguente lui avrebbe avuto il permesso di riportare la Lago- _ pus Scoticus, che io conoscevo bene, e da moltissimo tempo non gli permettevano di farlo. Volevo bene a Sandy e gioii con lui. Ma sentivo, non potevo evitarlo, che c'era qualcosa di sbagliato, qualcosa di sconnesso nel mio stesso atteggiamento. Feci di nuovo gli occhi dolci a Flora nelle stanze della servitù; il risultato fu abbastanza soddisfacente. Mi sentivo quasi sazio, ma a assimilai completamente il Bob Martin, In fondo, a lui em andava bene così e aveva sempre ragione. Ma ormai sapevo di detestarla; lei continuava a colorirsi in viso.
Compresi come mai lui mi avesse parlato, una volta, di qualcosa di fresco al pari di un maggio. Inoltre lei portava i capelli in un malizioso ammasso di ricciolini, qualcosa che nella nostra famiglia di certo non si faceva.

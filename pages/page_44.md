`I sometimes wish, and I wished then, that I had the gift of telling, or at least of following, a  story vividly.`

`Hodge, in the luxury of his first  St. Bruno, kept on exacerbating the corner of  my eye by fingering his sebaceous arrangement. `

`And this made it difficult to adequately  appreciate Henrys problem. Smells meant a lot to me ; I was back in a twinkling at the old fonda in Vera Cruz, and almost saw the young fruit merchant laying down his guitar and  wiping the blood off the strings with a kenspeckle handkerchief.`

`But I must, I felt, at all costs get back to Henry. The position was this : the second wifes brother had begun to suspect. He had found a half-burned marriage certificate in the incinerator ; that was charred lines on Henry. What would he do? We couldn't stop at this point, surely, I thought. But I was wrong.`

I sometimes wish, and I wished then, that I had 
the gift of telling, or at least of following, a

St. Bruno, kept on exacerbating the corner of 
my eye by fingering his sebaceous arrangement. 
And this made it difficult to adequately 
appreciate Henrys problem. Smells meant a lot 
to me ; I was back in a twinkling at the old 
fonda in Vera Cruz, and almost saw the young 
fruit merchant laying down his guitar and 
wiping the blood off the strings with a 
kenspeckle handkerchief. But I must, I felt, at 
all costs get back to Henry. The position was 
this : the second wifes brother had begun to

certificate in the incinerator ; that was charred 
lines on Henry. What would he do? We couldnt

**Italian text**:

A volte desidero, e lo desideravo anche allora, avere il dono di saper raccontare, o almeno di saper seguire vividamente una storia. Lo Zotico, nel lusso del suo primo St. Bruno, non smetteva di esasperare l'angolo del mio campo visivo tormentandosi quel bitorzolo. E questo rendeva difficile considerare in maniera adeguata il problema di Henry. Gli odori avevano un grande significato per me ; in un batter d'occhio mi ritrovai al vecchio ancoraggio di Vera Cruz, e mi sembr√≤ di vedere il giovane venditore di frutta appoggiare la chitarra e ripulire dal sangue le corde con un vistoso fazzoletto. Ma, lo sentivo, dovevo tornare da Henry a ogni costo. La situazione era questa : il fratello della seconda moglie aveva cominciato a sospettare. Lui aveva trovato nell'inceneritore un certificato di matrimonio mezzo bruciato ; e quello era un marchio di infamia su Henry. Cosa avrebbe fatto? Certo, a quel punto non ci potevamo fermare, pensavo. Ma mi sbagliavo.

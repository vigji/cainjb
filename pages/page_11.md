`If Henry had been there he could have told me what to do. His great voice, tuned and broken at the capstan bar, would have breezily put me right.`

`Tears came to my eyes. I was, I supposed, an emotional old fool.So I came back and waited in Orchard, it ran through my head, where he cast up blinded that night, which were my true friend Ravager, which were always good to me since we was almost pups, and never minded of my short legs.`

`Very emotional. But there was no need for me to weep just at the end of the second dog, nor would I.`

`Henry had taught me a little of his trade, and this, curiously enough, was what had struck.`

`After all the Grundy Sapphic of yesterday had described a more universal taking off in Ireland.` spoonerism -> Sunday Graphic, tabloid

`I did not quite agree with de Quincey that murders in Ireland did not count.`

`But perhaps it was an optimistic memory which told me that such things used not to happen when the queer old Dean was alive.` before 22/01/1901

If Henry had been there he could have told me
what to do. His great voice, tuned and broken
at the capstan bar, would have breezily put me
right. Tears came to my eyes. I was, I supposed,
an emotional old fool. So I came back and
waited in Orchard, it ran through my head,
where he cast up blinded that night, which
were my true friend Ravager, which were
always good to me since we was almost pups,
and never minded of my short legs. Very
emotional. But there was no need for me to
weep just at the end of the second dog, nor
would I. Henry had taught me a little of his
trade, and this, curiously enough, was what had
struck. After all the Grundy Sapphic of
yesterday had described a more universal taking
off in Ireland. I did not quite agree with de
Quincey that murders in Ireland did not count.
But perhaps it was an optimistic memory which
told me that such things used not to happen
when the queer old Dean was alive.

**Italian text**:

Se Henry fosse stato presente, avrebbe potuto dirmi che fare. La sua voce splendida, allenata e spezzata alla barra dell'argano, mi avrebbe messo allegramente sulla strada giusta. Mi vennero le lacrime agli occhi. Ero, immaginavo, alla mercé della vecchiaia e di una sciocca emotività. Recitai a mente. Quindi tornai e attesi a Orchard, dove quella sera finì accecato il mio vero amico Ravager che è stato molto buono con me fin da quando eravamo cuccioli e non ha mai badato alle mie zampe corte. Molto commovente. Ma non dovevo piangere proprio per la fine del secondo cane e non lo avrei fatto. Henry mi aveva insegnato qualcosa del suo mestiere e questo, cosa abbastanza curiosa, era ciò che mi era rimasto. In fondo, il giornale del giorno prima aveva parlato di molti omicidi in Irlanda. Non concordavo appieno con de Quincey quando affermava che le uccisioni in Irlanda non erano importanti, Forse, però, era un ricordo ottimistico a dirmi che queste cose non accadevano quando la cara, vecchia regina a viva.

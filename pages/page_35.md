`For this time being, Henry was drawing towards a close. I was not sorry.`

` The police were after him in no uncertain manner, and it seemed impossible for him to ultimately escape them. While the flying squad had surrounded the house, the locals were thronging the underground passage, and Wellington Crisp, with his assistant and his bulldog, was pouring through the concealed panel in the bathroom.`

`Instead of adding one more to his crimson list, he preferred to trust himself to a limping blimp : almost, it seemed, a certain suicide. But he might return. One never knew.`

`At least my end was reached, and in some comfort. Murders were funny things. If he who so tragically killed his King, ever reached here at all, which is historically more than doubtful (alas, poor Richard! Alas, poor Thomas!) it was certainly not in such ease or such good time as I.`

`I collected myself and mine, and went out to sniff the new air.`

For this time being, Henry was drawing 
towards a close. I was not sorry. The police 
were after him in no uncertain manner, and it 
seemed impossible for him to ultimately escape 
them. While the flying squad had surrounded 
the house, the locals were thronging the 
underground passage, and Wellington Crisp, 
with his assistant and his bulldog, was pouring 
through the concealed panel in the bathroom. 
Instead of adding one more to his crimson list, 
he preferred to trust himself to a limping blimp 
: almost, it seemed, a certain suicide. But he 
might return. One never knew. At least my end 
was reached, and in some comfort. Murders 
were funny things. If he who so tragically killed 
his King, ever reached here at all, which is 
historically more than doubtful (alas, poor 
Richard! Alas, poor Thomas!) it was certainly 
not in such ease or such good time as I. I 
collected myself and mine, and went out to

**Italian text**:

Al momento, Henry stava arrivando alla stretta finale.
Non mi dispiaceva. La polizia, non c'erano dubbi, gli stava dando la caccia e sembrava impossibile che alla fine lui riuscisse a sfuggirle. Mentre la squadra volante circondava la casa, i poliziotti locali si stavano pigiando nel passaggio sotterraneo, e Wellington Crisp, con il suo assistente e il suo bulldog, stava attraversando il pannello nascosto nella stanza da bagno. Anziché aggiungerne un altro alla sua lista cremisi, preferì affidarsi a un pallone aerostatico scassato : sembrava un suicidio pressoché sicuro. Ma potrebbe tornare.
Non si può mai sapere. Io, almeno, avevo raggiunto l'obiettivo, e con una certa comodità. Gli omicidi erano buff. Se colui che aveva ucciso tanto tragicamente il suo Re fosse mai arrivato lì, cosa storicamente più che dubbia (Ahimè, povero Richard! Ahimè, povero Thomas!), non lo avrebbe certo fatto con la mia stessa facilità e il mio tempismo. Mi ripresi e raccolsi le mie cose, poi uscii ad annusare l'aria nuova.

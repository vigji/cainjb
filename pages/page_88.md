**Annotated text**:
`I always liked to listen to him. It was St. Wigberts day, I was told, and Augustus, I remembered, was a chubby lad.` 13 August. Augustus?

`I was getting  quite clever in that way. He said his stepson had  been misunderstood for a long time, and had  gone out to-day. He said his third son had been crude. I did not entirely understand ; but I had a lot of good Tate.` 

`She said to him. He said to her. The consequence was rather dreadful, but out of doors. I had got a little sick, too, of the way they went on ; like that Tom and Flora's Jasmine.` 

`Perhaps that was really it. They were having their first quarrel, about the new distemper. She was all for Dark French Grey and he for Egg Shell Green.`

`Yet I knew theyd get over that. I had. But each, too, began to say things about how few the other had done so late in the year.` 

`I dont know why, but I felt that mice were dancing on my little slab.`

I always liked to listen to him. It was St. 
Wigberts day, I was told, and Augustus, I 
remembered, was a chubby lad. I was getting 
quite clever in that way. He said his stepson had 
been misunderstood for a long time, and had 
gone out to-day. He said his third son had been 
crude. I did not entirely understand ; but I had 
a lot of good Tate. She said to him. He said to 
her. The consequence was rather dreadful, but 
out of doors. I had got a little sick, too, of the 
way they went on ; like that Tom and Floras 
Jasmine. Perhaps that was really it. They were 
having their first quarrel, about the new 
distemper. She was all for Dark French Grey 
and he for Egg Shell Green. Yet I knew theyd 
get over that. I had. But each, too, began to say 
things about how few the other had done so 
late in the year. I dont know why, but I felt 
that mice were dancing on my little slab.

**Italian text**:

Mi era sempre piaciuto ascoltarlo. Era il giorno di San Vigberto, mi dissero, e Augustus era un tipo rubizzo, rammentai. In quel senso stavo diventando abbastanza in gamba. Disse che il suo figliastro era stato frainteso a lungo, e oggi se n'era andato. Disse che il suo terzo figlio era stato rude. Io non compresi del tutto; ma mangiai molto buon Tate. Lei disse a lui. Lui disse a lei. Le Conseguenze furono abbastanza visibili, ma all'esterno.
Anch'io non ne potevo più di come andavano avanti ; come quel Tom e la Jasmine di Flora. Forse era tutto lì. Stavano litigando per la prima volta, una questione di colori e odori. Lei era tutta per il Dark French Grey, lui per l'Egg Shell Green. Eppure sapevo che avrebbero superato il problema. Ma ognuno cominciò anche a menzionare gli scarsi risultati conseguiti dall'altro in tutti quei mesi. Non so perché, ma ebbi la sensazione che i topi stessero ballando sulla mia piccola lapide.

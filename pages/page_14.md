**Annotated text**:
`My ears were becoming attuned, and for the first time I heard clearly what the woman was saying : “Are you going to leave everything to me?” she asked, and I could have sworn her companion started. Then seeing, or thinking he saw, his mistake, he answered : “You must do just as you think fit, May.” After all it was none of my business. Some fragments of dejected flesh still lay among the rests of the spilled wine. At my sign, Henry stooped and made all clean again. And there was no immediate call for me to listen further, for there came a pause during which both seemed busy with their thoughts. And I too thought. The voice was like and yet not like that of Janetta Sheringham. How we had laughed that day in the hay field when John sat on the buttered rolls, and we devised games out of straws, and we thought the cricket a war-horse, barded and chaufroned too, real fairy, with wings all right.`

**Italian text**:

Le mie orecchie si stavano adattando e, per la prima volta, riuscii a sentire chiaramente cosa diceva la don-na: «Lascerai tutto nelle mie mani?» chiese, e potrei giurare che il suo compagno trasalì. Poi comprenden-do, o credendo di comprendere, il suo errore, le rispose : «Devi fare ciò che ritieni giusto, May». In fondo non erano fatti miei. Alcuni frammenti spezzettati di carne nuotavano ancora nel vino. A un mio cenno, Henry si chinò e sgombrò tutto. Non dovetti riprendere subito ad ascoltare perché ci fu una pausa durante la quale i due sembrarono immersi nei loro pensieri. E anch'io rimuginai. La voce somigliava a quella di Ja-netta Sheringham, ma non era uguale. Come avevamo riso quel giorno nel campo di fieno, quando John si era seduto sui panini imburrati, avevamo inventato giochi con i fili di paglia e pensavamo che il grillo fosse un cavallo da guerra, bardato e con testiera, magico e alato.

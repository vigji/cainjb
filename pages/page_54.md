**Notes**: to-day? instead of today? in the whole book though


**Annotated text**:
`I was feeling about as good as man could feel that day. Everything horticultural, in the awful and literal sense of the word, was lovely.` 

`Green blood, as I considered before breakfast, I delighted to conserve.` 

`I received a letter from Miss Doncaster over the crumbs of toast and the last clear smear of marmalade, telling me that the old man would be coming to-day, on her advice to take mine.`

`I admit that she had stirred me strangely. I lit a Nestor and considered her letter once more.`

`To pestle a poisoned poison behind his crimson lights. That was a nice thing to ask of a comparative stranger.`

`It would have to be scanned. Poor old man; but everyone must bump up against his Waterloo, and to-day was the day of the meeting at La Belle Alliance. It was not appropriate.` 18 June 1815

I was feeling about as good as man could feel 
that day. Everything horticultural, in the awful 
and literal sense of the word, was lovely. Green 
blood, as I considered before breakfast, I 
delighted to conserve. I received a letter from 
Miss Doncaster over the crumbs of toast and 
the last clear smear of marmalade, telling me 
that the old man would be coming to-day, on 
her advice to take mine. I admit that she had 
stirred me strangely. I lit a Nestor and 
considered her letter once more. To pestle a 
poisoned poison behind his crimson lights. That 
was a nice thing to ask of a comparative 
stranger. It would have to be scanned. Poor old 
man ; but everyone must bump up against his 
Waterloo, and to-day was the day of the 
meeting at La Belle Alliance. It was not 
appropriate.

**Italian text**:

Quel giorno mi sentivo bene, per quanto è possibile.
Tutto ciò che riguardava l'orticoltura, nel senso orribile e letterale della parola, era gradevole. Sangue verde, valutavo prima di colazione, che ero felice di conservare. Ricevetti una lettera dalla signorina Don-caster, sopra le briciole del pane tostato e l'ultima chiazza di marmellata di arance, che mi diceva che il vecchio sarebbe arrivato oggi, dietro suo consiglio, per sentire il mio. Ammetto che lei mi aveva stuzzica--to in maniera strana. Accesi una Nestor e meditai di nuovo sulla sua lettera. Passare al pestello un venefico veleno dietro alle luci cremisi. Era una cosa carina da chiedere a una persona relativamente estranea.
Avrebbe dovuto essere analizzata. Povero vecchio ; ma ognuno deve andare a sbattere contro la propria Waterloo, e oggi era stato l'anniversario dell'incontro a La Belle Alliance. Non era inappropriato.

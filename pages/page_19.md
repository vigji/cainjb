**Annotated text**:
`Yesterday he got in another of his own kind, who agreed she’d done it all herself. He twiddled the polished knob and Mr. Hall came into the room again.`

`I heard him muttering that it was appropriate the Human Comedy couldn’t possibly have gone on beyond to-day.`

`I, rather surprisingly, liked music. Surprisingly, that is, to anyone who did not know that my people came from the same place as the McCrimmons, that famous race of hereditary music makers.`

`I was rather astonished to hear him saying something about someone who was by virtue first, then choice, a queen.`

`Tell me, if she were not design’d th’ eclipse and glory of her kind. So I pulled his sleeve. He pulled my ears, and said it was Wotton, which I didn’t think it was, and that she had only just come to Falkland.`

`I made a low noise and at once knew I had done the wrong thing. Usually he just said William Sydney Porter, which I offended ; but then he said something much worse.`

Yesterday he got in another of his own kind,
who agreed she’d done it all herself. He
twiddled the polished knob and Mr. Hall came
into the room again. I heard him muttering
that it was appropriate the Human Comedy
couldn’t possibly have gone on beyond to-day. I,
rather surprisingly, liked music. Surprisingly,
that is, to anyone who did not know that my
people came from the same place as the
McCrimmons, that famous race of hereditary
music makers. I was rather astonished to hear
him saying something about someone who was
by virtue first, then choice, a queen. Tell me, if
she were not design’d th’ eclipse and glory of
her kind. So I pulled his sleeve. He pulled my
ears, and said it was Wotton, which I didn’t
think it was, and that she had only just come to
Falkland. I made a low noise and at once knew
I had done the wrong thing. Usually he just said
William Sydney Porter, which I offended ; but
then he said something much worse.

**Italian text**:

Ieri lui ha fatto arrivare un altro del suo genere, che si è detto d'accordo che lei avesse fatto tutto da sola. Ha ruotato il pomello lucido e il signor Hall è entrato di nuovo nella stanza. Borbottava di quanto fosse appropriato che la Human Comedy non potesse proseguire un giorno di più. Era sorprendente, ma mi piaceva la musica. O, meglio, sorprendente per chiunque non sapesse che i miei provenivano dallo stesso luogo dei McCrimmon, la celebre stirpe ereditaria di musicisti.
Mi stupì sentirlo parlare di una persona che, dapprima per virtù, poi per scelta, era una regina. Ditemi se non era fatta per eclissare la gloria di quelle come lei.
Quindi gli tirai la manica. Lui mi tirò le orecchie e disse che era stato Wotton, cosa che io non credevo, e che lei era appena arrivata a Falkland. Emisi un lieve borbottio e seppi subito di aver fatto la cosa sbaglia-ta. Di solito lui si limitava a invocare il mio nome a gran voce, quando mi comportavo male; ma in quel momento disse qualcosa di decisamente peggiore.

`The others did not seem similarly impressed. Phrases of this and that came to half my ear, duet by rill and corncrake. Rill vaunted the pleasure of speeding, and corncrake gave warnings like an over-driven oak about to fall.`

`I remembered how I had listened for the same sound on that awful night in Paris, when I did not know what I know now.`

`And again, in this very place for another reason, Henry would remember. `

 
`To lose even two like these two, swallowed by the night, was apt to break a balance in one, to suggest that it was time to square accounts. Caseus, ah! And nothing lean or hungry here at all.`

`A friend in the nick of time. I would have no more. My hand dropped to my hip pocket.`

`I had to reckon with Henry. Yet could I? This nomenclature business had often bothered me.`

`Sometimes I felt sudden enough, as if my head would burst sometimes but triturative. Was I a bomb, or only slow and godly and exceeding small?`

The others did not seem similarly impressed. 
Phrases of this and that came to half my ear, 
duet by rill and corncrake. Rill vaunted the 
pleasure of speeding, and corncrake gave 
warnings like an over-driven oak about to fall. I 
remembered how I had listened for the same 
sound on that awful night in Paris, when I did 
not know what I know now. And again, in this 
very place for another reason, Henry would 
remember. To lose even two like these two, 
swallowed by the night, was apt to break a 
balance in one, to suggest that it was time to 
square accounts. Caseus, ah! And nothing lean 
or hungry here at all. A friend in the nick of 
time. I would have no more. My hand dropped 
to my hip pocket. I had to reckon with Henry. 
Yet could I? This nomenclature business had 
often bothered me. Sometimes I felt sudden 
enough, as if my head would burst  sometimes 
but triturative. Was I a bomb, or only slow and 
godly and exceeding small?

**Italian text**:

Gli altri non sembravano altrettanto colpiti. Mi giungevano all'orecchio brandelli di frasi su questo e quello, il duetto di un ruscello e di un re di quaglie. Il ruscello decantava il piacere della velocità, il re di quaglie lanciava avvertimenti come una quercia esausta sul punto di cadere. Rammentai di aver udito lo stesso suono in quella terribile notte a Parigi, quando non sapevo ciò che adesso so. E ancora una volta, in questo stesso posto per un motivo diverso, Henry avrebbe ricordato.
Perdere persino due come loro tra le fauci della notte rischiava di spezzare gli equilibri e suggeriva che fosse tempo di saldare i conti. Caseus, ah! E qui non c'è nulla di macilento e affamato. Un volto amico appena in tempo. Basta così. Portai la mano alla tasca sul fianco.
Dovevo saldare i conti con Henry. Ma potevo farlo?
Questa faccenda della nomenclatura mi ha spesso causato fastidio. A volte, all'improvviso, avevo la sensazione che mi scoppiasse la testa; succedeva di rado, ma era come se me la triturasse. Ero una bomba o soltanto il mulino di Dio, che macina lento ma sicuro?

`I had always thought that Tate essentially meant sugar. This I liked almost next to anything, though mostly not at once, but under the gas fire and pulled out when there was nobody else.` 

`But he said to her, as in the game a lot of them played there once, another had begun to-day, and had wormed his way into the Book of Common Prayer.`  

`But I didnt think he would tast so good ; I preferred the sugar one. I thought they were together too much. I became convinced that I must be a sad dog ; I tried to remember all the times when one of the other sex had preoccupied me, and we had been oblivious of all else. I tried to forgive.`

`He called her Crataegus Oxyacantha over the cocktails ; that was his big joke. I knew it by the way he laughed, and I too rolled about. But I liked the real way to call her best. I met Ecky that evening, he was very happy ; but just about all in. When I greeted him he nearly fell on my nose.`

I had always thought that Tate essentially 
meant sugar. This I liked almost next to 
anything, though mostly not at once, but under 
the gas fire and pulled out when there was 
nobody else. But he said to her, as in the game a 
lot of them played there once, another had 
begun to-day, and had wormed his way into the 
Book of Common Prayer. But I didnt think he 
would tast so good ; I preferred the sugar one. I 
thought they were together too much. I became 
convinced that I must be a sad dog ; I tried to 
remember all the times when one of the other 
sex had preoccupied me, and we had been 
oblivious of all else. I tried to forgive. He called 
her Crataegus Oxyacantha over the cocktails ; 
that was his big joke. I knew it by the way he 
laughed, and I too rolled about. But I liked the 
real way to call her best. I met Ecky that 
evening, he was very happy ; but just about all 
in. When I greeted him he nearly fell on my 
nose.

**Italian text**:

Avevo sempre creduto che Tate in sostanza significasse zucchero. Quasi nulla mi piaceva così tanto, anche se mi limitavo a prenderne un po' da sotto la stufa, quando non c'era nessuno. Ma lui le disse, come nel gioco che quelli come loro avevano giocato lì un tempo, che oggi come oggi uno aveva messo mano al Book of Common Prayer. Tuttavia non credevo che quel Tate avrebbe avuto un sapore così buono ; preferivo quello dello zucchero. Pensavo stessero fin troppo in-
sieme. Mi convinsi di essere un cane triste ; cercai di rammentare tutte le volte in cui un esponente dell'altro sesso mi aveva ossessionato al punto che ci eravamo scordati di tutto il resto. Cercai di perdonare.
Lui, bevendo cocktail, la chiamò Crataegus Oxyacan-tha; quello era il suo scherzo. Lo capii per il modo in cui rideva, e anch'io mi rotolai. Ma a me piaceva più di tutti il vero nome di lei. Quella sera incontrai Ecky, che era molto felice; ma proprio esausto. Quando lo salutai, poco mancò che mi cadesse sul naso.

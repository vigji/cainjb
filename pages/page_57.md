`It seemed from what I heard that Feltons meat had been delivered at Brookesley for the first time that day. I wondered if it was good and plentiful. Not that I really liked to think about meat, though we were alone again. I thought it crude of him to talk about no noise here, but the toning of a tear, or a sigh of such as bring cowslips for her covering, until I realised that he was thinking that Bens friend had been, in point of time, like Feltons meat. Over the Westphalian ham, which I contrived to share, he read bits of paper about Hilary and the Amazon, and Stella Polaris and Voltaire, and the City of Nagpur, and Vandyck, and other lovely people. I wondered if he wasnt thinking of going on a holiday. It seemed a pity to me ; so unnecessary, just then. I knew nothing at all about boats. Some of my people had known the old Armadale Castle well enough, doubtless ; but that wasnt the boat that went to South Africa.`

**Italian text**:
Da quanto avevo sentito sembrava che la carne di Felton
fosse stata consegnata a Brookesley per la prima
volta quel giorno. Mi chiesi se fosse buona e abbondante.
Non che mi piacesse particolarmente pensare
alla carne, anche se eravamo di nuovo solo noi due.
Trovai poco carino da parte sua parlare di non far rumore
qui, se non per lo stillare di una lacrima o un
sospiro delicato quanto le primule gialle per coprirla,
finché mi resi conto che stava pensando che l'amico
di Ben era stato, in qualche momento, come la carne
di Felton. Con davanti il prosciutto di Westfalia, che
feci in modo di condivi dere, lesse dei fogli che parlavano
della Hilary e dell'Amazzonia, della Stella Polaris
e della Volta ire, e della City of N agpur, e della
Vandyck e compagnia bella . Mi chiesi se non stesse
pensando di andare in vacanza . Mi sembrava un peccato
; e affatto appropriato, in quel momento. Non
sapevo nulla di navi . Alcuni dei miei conoscevano il
vecchio Armadale Castle abbastanza bene, senza dubbio
; ma non era quella la nave che andò in Sudafrica .

`I was true to time. I had, it occurred to me, been something of an automaton.`

`But wasnt I thrusting my head, when bent on such a business in this street, into the twin mouths of two lions, of Mycrofts brother and of the pale but multitudinous Blake?`

`Often as a schoolboy they had guyed my name to a whiskified objectionable one. Whiskified objectionable was Kipling. And I blubbed with my face in the mackintoshes.`

`But I thanked heaven that their childish jibe was true. I was still going strong. The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep? I only knew that all the weary business was ended.`

`I looked across the table and saw that she was asleep. A nice old thing. I put Henrys keenness a few inches below the withered salt-cellar. I drove Henry home, and left him. A dog barked and mourned from the next room, but I could have all the stuff I wanted for ever.`

I was true to time. I had, it occurred to me, 
been something of an automaton. But wasnt I 
thrusting my head, when bent on such a 
business in this street, into the twin mouths of 
two lions, of Mycrofts brother and of the pale 
but multitudinous Blake? Often as a schoolboy 
they had guyed my name to a whiskified 
objectionable one. Whiskified objectionable 
was Kipling. And I blubbed with my face in the 
mackintoshes. But I thanked heaven that their 
childish jibe was true. I was still going strong. 
The murderer that is to be hung next day, how 
does he sleep? I only knew that all the weary 
business was ended. I looked across the table 
and saw that she was asleep. A nice old thing. I 
put Henrys keenness a few inches below the 
withered salt-cellar. I drove Henry home, and

**Italian text**:

Ero fedele al tempo. Mi sovvenne di essere stato una
sorta di automa. Ma non stavo forse infilando la
testa, mentre mi occupavo di queste cose per strada,
nelle bocche gemelle di due leoni, del fratello di
Mycroft e del pallido ma poliedrico Blake? Spesso
a scuola avevano legato il mio nome a quello di un
deplorevole bevitore di whisky. Kipling era un deplorevole
bevitore di whisky. E io piagnucolavo con la
faccia nel vaso delle caramelle. Ma ringraziai il cielo
che il loro scherno infantile fosse vero. Mi stavo
ancora facendo le ossa . L'assassino che sarà impiccato
l'indomani, come dormirà ? E l'assassinato come
dormirà ? Sapevo soltanto che quella faccenda estenuante
era finita. Guardai all'altro lato del tavolo e
vidi che lei era addormentata . Una vecchietta carina.
Appoggiai la punta di Henry qualche pollice sotto le
clavicole avvizzite. Accompagnai a casa Henry e lo lasciai.
Un cane abbaiò e uggiolò dalla stanza accanto,
ma io potevo avere per sempre tutto ciò che volevo.

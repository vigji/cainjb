**Annotated text**:
```
Then there disappeared the last rose flivers of 
the Prussian beast. He had died to stay this 
mimic artistry, and had not had an inkling of it. 
The lips were wiped clean. He handed me the 
new instrument, and stood half in furtive 
assurance and half, I thought, in fear. I felt I 
could afford to be suave. If you would care to 
verify the incident, pray do so. I never travel 
without my diary. One should always have 
something sensational to read in the train. But 
this memorial of, as I thought, a soon to be 
dead womans silly wishes, now cleverly guided 
a little, by a stranger if falser hand, was even 
more so. We that did nothing study but the way 
to love each other, with which thoughts the day 
rose with delight to us and with them set, must, 
as Henry said, learn the hateful art, how to 
forget. Yes, I would have to learn that.

**Annotated text**:
`Then there disappeared the last rose flivers of the Prussian beast. He had died to stay this mimic artistry, and had not had an inkling of it. The lips were wiped clean. He handed me the new instrument, and stood half in furtive assurance and half, I thought, in fear. I felt I could afford to be suave. If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so. I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train. But this memorial of, as I thought, a soon to be dead womans silly wishes, now cleverly guided a little, by a stranger if falser hand, was even more so. We that did nothing study but the way to love each other, with which thoughts the day rose with delight to us and with them set, must, as Henry said, learn the hateful art, how to forget. Yes, I would have to learn that.`

**Italian text**:

Poi sparirono gli ultimi frammenti rosa della bestia prussiana. Lui era morto per conservare quella finta vena artistica, senza averne la minima idea. Le labbra erano pulite. Mi porse il nuovo strumento e rimase in piedi, in parte con una furtiva sicurezza di sé e in parte, pensai, per paura. Ritenni di potermi permettere di essere affabile. Se volete sincerarvene, ecco qua. lo non viaggio mai senza il mio diario. Bisogna sempre avere qualcosa di sensazionale da leggere in treno. Ma questa testimonianza degli sciocchi desideri di colei che, pensavo, presto sarebbe stata una donna morta, ora guidata un poco con intelligenza da una mano estranea benché falsa, lo era anche di più. Noi che non facemmo altro che studiare il modo di amarci, e con questo pensiero sorgeva il giorno per nostro grande diletto e con lo stesso tramonta-va, dobbiamo - come disse Henry - apprendere l'o-diosa arte di dimenticare. Sì, avrei dovuto imparare.

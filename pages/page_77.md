**Annotated text**:
`Compact, they call it ; but when I used it, I was feeling anything but so. Dont think me squeamish ; it was my first. The last little contact with the bony ankles, so warm and so soon, if Natures great force were to do its work, to be so cold, had touched me, I confess it. Though I was alone again, it took me a few minutes to visualise Henrys predicament with the detached calm which it deserved. That old aunt of his third wife had turned up again. Strangely enough a jellyfish had plugged the solution of her motor boats continuity. And there she was back again, alert, suspicious, very much alive. I couldnt help being sorry for Henry. And I couldnt help being sorry for Perceval. Murders were funny things. That days killing of Perceval, and in so public a place, seemed to me unwarrantable. But I had never been strong on politics. For the other, my own, though it was understandable, there was perhaps no utter warrant.`

**Italian text**:
La definiscono compatta ; ma, quando la utilizzai, non
mi sembrò affatto tale. Non pensate che io sia una persona
schizzinosa ; era la mia prima volta. Quell'ultimo,
fugace contatto con le caviglie ossute, che, se la grande
forza della Natura avesse fatto il suo lavoro, da calde
ben presto sarebbero diventate fredde, aveva avuto un
certo effetto su di me, lo confesso. Anche se ero di nuovo
senza compagnia, mi ci volle qualche minuto per visualizzare
la difficile situazione di Henry con la calma
distaccata che meritava. Quella bisbetica zia della sua
terza moglie era riapparsa. Stranamente una medusa
aveva ostruito la falla nella sua barca a motore. Ed eccola
di nuovo, attenta, sospettosa, e più viva che mai.
Non potei evitare di provare dispiacere per Henry. E
non potei evitare di provare dispiacere per Perceval.
Gli omicidi erano buffi. L'uccisione di Perceval quel
giorno, e in un l uogo così pubblico, mi sembrava ingiustificabile
. Ma la politica non era mai stata il mio
forte. Per il resto, per il mio, anche se era comprensibile,
forse non esisteva una giustificazione assoluta .

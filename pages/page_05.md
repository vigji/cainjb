Emperor's peg?


**Annotated text**:
`I hated my eye for being caught by what didn’t concern me : the powerful grip of the new young man. But it was parading a couple of letters for all to see. Thomas Hardy had been, and my doctor uncle in the war had been just the reverse.`

`And I would have to cut out the stops, I realised futilely, for something vaguely Buddhistic.`

`He went on about Browning. I always used Bisto myself, and anyway Henry, the angel, was plying his intended fifth with Emperor’s Peg---equal parts of vitriol and applejack in his case---at the top of the ruined lighthouse.` Bisto: gravvy powder, also by Cerebos

`I incontinently powdered my nose. He told me that, as far as I could gather, a certain good-looking Evelyn Hope was dead.` Robert Browning poem

`What Hopes? I meant, did one know the family? It was really the way he took it for granted that I would rather hear him talking about Cerebos and Cerebos and Cerebos or something than attend to poor Henry that irritated me beyond endurance.` Cerebos and Cerebos and Cerebos: company of nutritional supplements/salts

I hated my eye for being caught by what didn’t
concern me : the powerful grip of the new
young man. But it was parading a couple of
letters for all to see. Thomas Hardy had been,
and my doctor uncle in the war had been just
the reverse. And I would have to cut out the
stops, I realised futilely, for something vaguely
Buddhistic. He went on about Browning. I
always used Bisto myself, and anyway Henry,
the angel, was plying his intended fifth with
Emperor’s Peg---equal parts of vitriol and
applejack in his case---at the top of the ruined
lighthouse. I incontinently powdered my nose.
He told me that, as far as I could gather, a
certain good-looking Evelyn Hope was dead.
What Hopes? I meant, did one know the
family? It was really the way he took it for
granted that I would rather hear him talking
about Cerebos and Cerebos and Cerebos or
something than attend to poor Henry that
irritated me beyond endurance.

**Italian text**:
Odiai il mio occhio che si era fatto catturare da ciò che non mi riguardava: la solida presa sulla valigia del giovane appena arrivato. Ma ostentava un paio di lettere affinché tutti le vedessero. Lo era stato Thomas Hardy, e mio zio medico di guerra era stato l'esatto opposto.
Quelle lettere avevano qualcosa di vagamente buddhista e mi convinsi di dover agire in fretta. Lui proseguì con Browning. Personalmente ho sempre usato Bisto, e comunque Henry, l'angelo, stava rimpinzando quella che sarebbe diventata la sua quinta vittima di Em-peror's Peg - nel suo caso parti uguali di vetriolo e applejack - sulla sommità del faro in rovina. Io continuavo a incipriarmi oltremodo il naso. A quanto capii, lui mi disse che una certa Evelyn Hope, di bell'aspetto, era morta. Quali Hope? Intendevo dire, qualcuno conosce forse la famiglia? Il modo in cui dava per scontato che avrei preferito sentirlo parlare di Cerebos e Ce-rebos e Cerebos, o di altro, che occuparmi del povero Henry mi irritava al di là di qualsiasi sopportazione.

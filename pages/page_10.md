**Annotated text**:
`Then came Hyacinth’s day. He laughed when he remembered that, as we were walking round the garden, and said it was too late for Jasmine’s day at any rate.` 17 August?

`I liked to hear him laugh, and thought it was absurd for him to be called after what the man Boots didn’t understand.`  ??? Rudyard Kipling poem?

`The latter’s way of expressing himself seemed to me childish ; why should we, of all people, use singular for plural and plural for singular?` 

`They went back two days and formulated their bet, till I could have howled. If he got the third point, she’d owe him a box of a hundred Egyptian cigarettes---Gourdoulis, and if she won, he’d give her three pairs of Etam dawn mist, ten inches.` 

`They looked so bright about it all.`

`She drooped long seed pearl things right over the soup. Ear-drops, as my mother had called them, I never could abide ; probably because I belonged to the other side of the family.`

`My mistress wore them ; was it for that that I had begun to tire of her already?`

Then came Hyacinth’s day. He laughed when he
remembered that, as we were walking round
the garden, and said it was too late for
Jasmine’s day at any rate. I liked to hear him
laugh, and thought it was absurd for him to be
called after what the man Boots didn’t
understand. The latter’s way of expressing
himself seemed to me childish ; why should we,
of all people, use singular for plural and plural
for singular? They went back two days and
formulated their bet, till I could have howled.
If he got the third point, she’d owe him a box of
a hundred Egyptian cigarettes---Gourdoulis,
and if she won, he’d give her three pairs of
Etam dawn mist, ten inches. They looked so
bright about it all. She drooped long seed pearl
things right over the soup. Ear-drops, as my
mother had called them, I never could abide ;
probably because I belonged to the other side
of the family. My mistress wore them ; was it
for that that I had begun to tire of her already?

```
Poi venne il giorno di Giacinto. Lui rise quando se ne rammentò, mentre camminavamo per il giardino, e disse che, in ogni caso, era troppo tardi per il giorno di Jasmine. Mi piaceva sentirlo ridere, e pensai che era assurdo che lui portasse il nome di quello che il mio compare Boots non capiva. Il modo di esprimersi di quest'ultimo mi sembrava infantile; perché proprio noi, fra tutti, dovevamo usare il singolare come plurale e il plurale come singolare? Tornarono indietro di due giorni e formularono la scommessa fino a farmi quasi ululare. Se lui avesse fatto il terzo punto, lei avrebbe dovuto dargli una scatola di cento sigarette egiziane, Gourdoulis, se avesse vinto lei, lui le avrebbe dato tre paia di Etam, color rugiada dell'alba, da dieci pollici. Sembravano molto allegri per tutto. Lei faceva ondeggiare sulla zuppa cose pendenti come lunghe perle coltivate. Gocce, come le chiamava mia madre, che non ho mai potuto soffrire; probabilmente perché appartenevo all'altro ramo della famiglia. La mia signora le usava; forse era per questo che già avevo cominciato a stancarmi di lei?

**Annotated text**:
`I saw to it that I should be for a moment alone among the marigolds. Thinking kindly of those two other flowers, which I felt almost certain now would win me the girl I felt I could love, I exulted.`

`Dear old Gerard, he said it was called Calendula as it is to be seene to flower in the calends of almost everie month.`

`I turned the strong searchlights of my eyes upon the orange tinted documents.`

`But I could not read them. My eyes, or something, were not good enough. And yet I was not among those who attempt, ek parergou, to confound ephphatha with epea pteroenta.` ek parergou: ancient Greek, "as a secondary matter" or "incidentally"; ephphatha  Aramaic word that means "Be opened." (appear in New Testament, Mark 7:34); Ancient Greek and translates as "winged words."; used in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey to describe spoken words that "fly" from one person to another, carrying their meaning swiftly, like birds in flight. WTF?

`You would have noticed my oriental preference when I smoke, and would not have been surprised that my Indian tobacco, after a scant four-and-twenty hours, was doing excellent work.` Indian tobacco: lobelia

`It seemed almost certain that the blight would be destroyed: the blight on the May, or on the delight that is as wide-eyed as a marigold.`

I saw to it that I should be for a moment alone 
among the marigolds. Thinking kindly of those 
two other flowers, which I felt almost certain 
now would win me the girl I felt I could love, I 
exulted. Dear old Gerard, he said it was called 
Calendula as it is to be seene to flower in the 
calends of almost everie month. I turned the 
strong searchlights of my eyes upon the orange 
tinted documents. But I could not read them. 
My eyes, or something, were not good enough. 
And yet I was not among those who attempt, 
ek parergou, to confound ephphatha with epea 
pteroenta. You would have noticed my oriental 
preference when I smoke, and would not have 
been surprised that my Indian tobacco, after a 
scant four-and-twenty hours, was doing 
excellent work. It seemed almost certain that 
the blight would be destroyed : the blight on 
the May, or on the delight that is as wide-eyed 
as a marigold.

**Italian text**:

Feci in modo di restare per un momento in solitudine tra le calendule. Ed esultai pensando con benevolenza agli altri due fiori che, quasi ne avevo la certezza, mi avrebbero fatto conquistare la ragazza che sentivo di poter amare. Il caro, vecchio Gerard disse che si chiamava Calendula, poiché fiorisce alle calendae quasi ogni mese. Volsi i forti riflettori dei miei occhi sui fogli color arancio. Ma non riuscivo a leggerli. I miei occhi, o qualcos'altro, non erano abbastanza buo-ni. Eppure non ero tra coloro che cercano, ek pare-rogu, di confondere ephphatha con épea Pteroenta.
Avrete notato la mia preferenza per l'Oriente quando fumo, e non mi avrebbe sorpreso se il mio tabacco indiano, dopo appena ventiquattro ore, avesse fatto un lavoro eccellente. Sembrava quasi sicuro che la sventura sarebbe stata distrutta : la distruzione di maggio o sul diletto ingenuo come una calendula.

**Notes**:


**Annotated text**:

`To have slept and to wake right up surrounded by an atmosphere in which Bunny and Perry went at it hammer and tongs, seemed almost sacrilege.` Bunny Austin and Fred Perry, tennis players? A specific match day?

`That was the day when I was going to do a thing I had never done before. 
I looked at Henry, and felt a little sick. I took two pills. I had too soon---
perhaps I did not want to go even so quickly as my ordered slowness---
exchanged a tennis venue for a rowing one.` 

`I was not in Dorset ; but I murmured to myself that Ellen Brine of 
Allenburn would never more return.`[poem from William Barnes](https://allpoetry.com/Ellen-Brine-Ov-Allenburn) `The connection was obvious.`

`What a day, I thought, for the despatch of Paris and Leonidas. 
Cambridge or Thermopylae? But Paris? I had never at school looked upon him as in any sort a healer.`

`I had, infact, never heard of John Ayrton then.` [John Ayrton Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ayrton_Paris) Paris advocated for the use of scientifically assessed herbal preparations in medical treatment. Born in Cambridge 7 August 1785. Inventor of taumatropes.

`Oeuvre ton ame et ton oreille au son de ma mandoline : pour toi jai fait, pour toi, cette chanson cruelle et caline.` -> Open your soul and your ear to the sound of my mandolin: for you, I made, for you, this song both cruel and tender.

`But I wasn't thinking of John Ayrton.`

do a thing I had never done before. I looked at 
Henry, and felt a little sick. I took two pills. I 
had too soon---perhaps I did not want to go 
even so quickly as my ordered 
slowness---exchanged a tennis venue for a

murmured to myself that Ellen Brine of 
Allenburn would never mwore return. The 
connection was obvious. What a day, I thought, 
for the despatch of Paris and Leonidas. 
Cambridge or Thermopylae? But Paris? I had

**Italian text**:

Sembrò quasi un sacrilegio aver dormito e svegliarsi subito in un'atmosfera in cui Bunny e Perry si attaccavano senza esclusione di colpi. Era il giorno in cui avrei fatto una cosa mai provata prima. Guardai Henry e provai una certa nausea. Presi due pillole.
Troppo presto - forse non volevo assecondare la mia ordinata lentezza -, avevo scambiato una sede del tennis con una del canottaggio. Non ero nel Dorset; ma mormorai tra me e me che Ellen Brine di Allenburn non sarebbe mai più tornata. Il collegamento era ovvio. Che giornata, pensai, per la partenza di Paris e Leonida. Cambridge o Termopili? Ma Paris? A scuola non lo avevo mai considerato un guaritore. In re-altà, all'epoca non avevo mai sentito parlare di John Ayrton. Ouvre ton âme et ton oreille au son de ma mandoline : pour toi j'ai fait, pour toi, cette chanson cruelle et câline. Ma io non pensavo a John Ayrton.

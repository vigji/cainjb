`I had gone to sleep the night before after rereading Typhoon. It had always struck me as a remarkable work.` short novel by Joseph Conrad; published in New York by Putnam in 1902; also, TYPHOON A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS BY MELCHIOR LENGYEL ENGLISH VERSION BY LAURENCE IRVING. Featuring a Renard-Beinsky character. [text](https://archive.org/stream/typhoonlengyel00lengiala/typhoonlengyel00lengiala_djvu.txt)

`Now was the hour when Charles Victor Hugo Renard-Beinsky had risen untimely for the sake of the investigating judge.` "... I,  Charles  Victor  Hugo Renard-Beinsky,  half  Pole,  half  Frenchman ..."

`But the very phrase struck chill like the slap of the Firth of Forth above the heart, wading out over the coal dust in the morning.`

`I had investigated ; but who would believe an investigator who had not stirred from Baker Street? I was a judge, but with no sombre little cap, and no machinery to make my judgements effective.`

`I felt I needed something. Would I be comforted by a Jew’s lime and the concomitant odour?` limequat, a hybrid fruit that is a cross between a lime and a kumquat. The limequat is a small citrus fruit with a tart, slightly sweet flavor, and it is known for being edible whole, including the peel. also asphalt, bitumen, pitch

`I tried, and felt relieved. Someone had advised me, a few days before, to read Conrad in search of his Youth, or in Search of a Father, was it? But I had always found Conrad unreadable, as far from English as the Poles, and did not mean to try again.`

I had gone to sleep the night before after
rereading Typhoon. It had always struck me as
a remarkable work. Now was the hour when
Charles Victor Hugo Renard-Beinsky had risen
untimely for the sake of the investigating judge.
But the very phrase struck chill like the slap of
the Firth of Forth above the heart, wading out
over the coal dust in the morning. I had
investigated ; but who would believe an
investigator who had not stirred from Baker
Street? I was a judge, but with no sombre little
cap, and no machinery to make my judgements
effective. I felt I needed something. Would I be
comforted by a Jew’s lime and the concomitant
odour? I tried, and felt relieved. Someone had
advised me, a few days before, to read Conrad
in search of his Youth, or in Search of a Father,
was it? But I had always found Conrad
unreadable, as far from English as the Poles,
and did not mean to try again.

**Italian text**:

La sera prima avevo riletto Typhoon prima di andare a dormire. Mi era sempre sembrata un'opera no-tevole. Adesso era l'ora in cui Charles Victor Hugo
Renard-Beinsky si era alzato anzitempo per il giudice inquirente. Ma quella frase mi agghiacciò come una folata di vento sul Firth of Forth, che svanisce nella polvere di carbone al mattino. Avevo indagato ; ma chi avrebbe creduto a un'investigatrice che non si era mossa da Baker Street? lo ero un giudice, ma privo dello scuro copricapo e senza un macchinario che desse efficacia alle mie sentenze. Sentivo di aver bisogno qualcosa. Mi avrebbe dato conforto il succo di limetta con il suo profumo? Provai, e ne trassi sollievo. Qualche giorno prima mi avevano consigliato di leggere Conrad in cerca della sua Giovinezza, o era la Vecchiaia? Ma Conrad mi era sempre sembrato illeggibile, lontano dall'inglese quanto lo sono i polacchi, e non avevo intenzione di riprovarci.

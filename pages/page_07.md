**Notes**:


**Annotated text**:
I had gone to sleep the night before after
rereading Typhoon. It had always struck me as
a remarkable work. Now was the hour when
Charles Victor Hugo Renard-Beinsky had risen
untimely for the sake of the investigating judge.
But the very phrase struck chill like the slap of
the Firth of Forth above the heart, wading out
over the coal dust in the morning. I had
investigated ; but who would believe an
investigator who had not stirred from Baker
Street? I was a judge, but with no sombre little
cap, and no machinery to make my judgements
effective. I felt I needed something. Would I be
comforted by a Jew’s lime and the concomitant
odour? I tried, and felt relieved. Someone had
advised me, a few days before, to read Conrad
in search of his Youth, or in Search of a Father,
was it? But I had always found Conrad
unreadable, as far from English as the Poles,
and did not mean to try again.

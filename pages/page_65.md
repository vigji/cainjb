`I started to read Hardys exquisite production, and every muscle of my brain was enthralled until I came to the end.`

`Just such another must have been the Monk Arnulphus when he uncorked his ink. His palette gleamed with a burnished green as bright as a dragon-flys skin : his gold-leaf shone like the robe of a queen.`

`There could be no slightest doubt. I would now be able to reap the harvest. And Ruth would have little gleaning.`

`I thought of her mother and laughed aloud. All women biome like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. Thats his.`

`I could not help echoing Jacks question : is that clever? The Monk Arnulphus, with a dash of Jim the Penman.`

`How, I wondered, did I strike him? I knew I should like to. His was obviously a slow methodical brain, used to pigeon-holing by type. In that case, I thought I knew the type : learned in a macabre way, even distinguished.`

I started to read Hardys exquisite production, 
and every muscle of my brain was enthralled 
until I came to the end. Just such another must 
have been the Monk Arnulphus when he 
uncorked his ink. His palette gleamed with a 
burnished green as bright as a dragon-flys skin 
: his gold-leaf shone like the robe of a queen. 
There could be no slightest doubt. I would now 
be able to reap the harvest. And Ruth would 
have little gleaning. I thought of her mother 
and laughed aloud. All women biome like their 
mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. 
Thats his. I could not help echoing Jacks 
question : is that clever? The Monk Arnulphus, 
with a dash of Jim the Penman. How, I 
wondered, did I strike him? I knew I should 
like to. His was obviously a slow methodical 
brain, used to pigeon-holing by type. In that 
case, I thought I knew the type : learned in a 
macabre way, even distinguished.

**Italian text**:
Cominciai a leggere la squisita produzione d i Hardy e
ogni muscolo del mio cervello rimase affascinato fino
a quando giunsi alla fine. Un altro come lui doveva
essere il Monaco Arnulfo quando stappava la boccetta
dell'inchiostro. La tavolozza brillava di verde brunito,
lucente come la pelle di una libellula, la foglia d'oro
riluceva come la veste di una regina. Non ci poteva
essere il minimo dubbio. Adesso avrei potuto mietere.
E Ruth avrebbe avuto poco da spigolare. Pensai a
sua madre e scoppiai a ridere. Tutte le donne diventano
come le loro madri. Questa è la loro tragedia.
Gli uomini non lo d iventano mai. E anche questa è
la loro tragedia. Non potei evitare di riprendere la
domanda di Jack : Scusa, ma è una battuta? Il monaco
Arnulfo con un pizzico di Jim the Penman. In
che modo, mi chiesi, lo avevo colpito? Sapevo che
mi sarebbe piaciuto farlo. Il suo cervello, evidentemente,
era lento e metodico, abituato a classificare
i caratteri. In quel caso, credetti di riconoscere il
tipo : istruito in maniera macabra, persino distinto.

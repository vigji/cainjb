What was it I held in my fingers? Looked at in 
one way it could just be a kea. I would give the 
bird a phoenix chance. I lit a match, and the 
consequences soothed me. Who was afraid of 
the big bad wolf? No one, it seemed. His silly 
bane had now definitely failed. I put, at petit 
djeuner,  the cast-iron old object on Gelsemium 
semper-virens. By the by, I had a visit on that 
day from a detective-sergeant about a poor 
fellow who had died strangely. My slight 
experience of detective-sergeants is that they 
have a manner ; but no plural. If you use a word 
of more than two syllables to them they think 
you are laughing at them. They are, to that 
extent, acute. Still it was awkward with Trinder 
about. It pleasured me, however, I must 
confess, to think that I was in a position, 
though the opportunity was unlikely, to 
entertain divine Xenocrate with an account of 
it all.

**Italian text**:
Che cosa tenevo tra le dita? Da una certa prospettiva, poteva sembrare un kea. Decisi però di dare una chance a quella Phenix, quindi accesi un fiammifero, con risultati illuminanti. A che serve una bellezza di un solo giorno? A niente, a quel che sembrava. Il suo vanesio veleno aveva fallito. Al petit déjeuner premetti il vecchio oggetto di ghisa sul Gelsemie semper-virens. A proposito, quel giorno ricevetti la visita di un sergente investigativo per via di un poveretto che era morto in maniera strana. La mia scarsa esperienza con i sergenti investigativi mi dice che hanno una maniera ; ma non buone maniere. Se con loro usi una parola che abbia più di due sillabe, credono che tu li stia deriden-do. Il loro acume non va oltre. Eppure era strano con Trinder in giro. Devo tuttavia confessare che mi fece molto piacere pensare di essere nella posizione, sebbene l'opportunità fosse improbabile, di intrattenere la divina Zenocrate con un resoconto di tutta la faccenda.

**Annotated text**:
`He was picking round among all she had left behind and found a box with his name on it. Also it said, for he read it, I always pay my debts. Unwrapped, it seemed to be a hundred box of Gourdoulis. I had never seen him so moved.` -> the Nestors of the bet

`He started reading a letter from a woman, dead the same day. I had yours but yesterday, it sai, though dated the third of February, in which you suppose me to be dead and buried.`

`I have already let you know I am still alive, he went on, but to say truth, I look upon my present circumstances to be exactly the same with those of departed spirits. I dont think he ever said any more. Happily I was behind the armchair. He just opened the box. I had never seen him so moved.`

`There were little bits of stuff like black pineapple on the carpet.`

`I knew he could never be his old collected self again, and that my gray hairs would go down in sorrow to the grave.`

He was picking round among all she had left 
behind and found a box with his name on it. 
Also it said, for he read it, I always pay my 
debts. Unwrapped, it seemed to be a hundred 
box of Gourdoulis. I had never seen him so 
moved. He started reading a letter from a 
woman, dead the same day. I had yours but 
yesterday, it sai, though dated the third of 
February, in which you suppose me to be dead 
and buried. I have already let you know I am 
still alive, he went on, but to say truth, I look 
upon my present circumstances to be exactly 
the same with those of departed spirits. I dont 
think he ever said any more. Happily I was 
behind the armchair. He just opened the box. I 
had never seen him so moved. There were little 
bits of stuff like black pineapple on the carpet. 
I knew he could never be his old collected self 
again, and that my gray hairs would go down in 
sorrow to the grave.

**Italian text**:

Lui stava raccogliendo tutto quello che lei aveva lasciato e trovò una scatola con sopra il suo nome. E diceva, visto che lui la lesse, pago sempre i miei debiti.
La scartò e sembrava una scatola da cento di Gour-doulis. Non l'avevo mai visto tanto a pezzi. Cominciò a leggere la lettera di una donna, morta quello stesso giorno. Ho ricevuto la vostra solo ieri, diceva, benché datata tre febbraio, nella quale immaginate che io sia morta e sepolta. Vi ho già fatto sapere di essere ancora viva, continuava, ma, a dire il vero, considero le attuali circostanze esattamente le stesse degli spiriti dei dipartiti. Non credo che abbia mai più detto altro. Fui felice di trovarmi dietro la poltrona. Lui si limitò ad aprire la scatola. Non l'avevo mai visto tanto a pezzi. Sul tappeto c'erano brandelli di qualcosa che somigliava a un ananas nero. Sapevo che non sarebbe mai più tornato padrone di sé, e che la mia canizie sarebbe scesa con dolore nella tomba.

`What chemistry! That the winds are really not infectious. Now that I was approaching journeys end, I began to ask myself disconcerting questions.`

`It would be terrible if she turned out to be Fleckers one. And some to Flecker turn to pray, and I toward thy bed. But I had probably got it wrong. Yet it was all right. Her spelling was different and it was long ago.`

`Yes, but supposing she came of the family of Jacks visitor, with Thornhill, who promised the opera? I could never be sure of that. I took a pill. But it was worth it. Yes, it was worth it.`

`The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden.` _This Compost_, by Walt Whitman

`He certainly could put that sort of thing over, the dear old bean.`

`Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potatos dark green leaves.` _This Compost_, by Walt Whitman

`Thames Dittons sister, as Eric Parker calls her---and one remembered the Irishmans malapropism in the same tale---had soon passed. Long she was; but I did not linger to pay court to her.`

**Italian text**:
Chimica mirabile ! Che i venti davvero non portino
infezioni. Avvicinandomi alla fine del mio viaggio,
cominciai a pormi sconcertanti domande. Sarebbe
terribile se lei si rivelasse quella di Flecker. E alcuni
si voltano per pregare verso Flecker, e io verso il tuo
letto. Probabilmente avevo capito male. Eppure andava
bene. l:ortografia del suo nome era diversa ed è
stato molto tempo fa. Sì, ma supponendo che lei provenisse
dalla famiglia del tizio che, visitando Jack in
prigione, insieme a Thornhill, gli aveva promesso l'opera?
Non ne avrei mai avuto la certezza. Presi una
pillola. Ma ne valeva la pena. Sì, ne valeva la pena. Il
fagiolo sbuca senza far rumore dal terriccio dell'orto.
Di certo il caro, vecchio fagiolo potrebbe mettere
fine a questa cosa. Da un monticello fedelmente
spuntano le foglie verde scuro della patata . La sorella
di Thames Ditton, come la chiama Eric Parker
- e ricordiamo la comica confusione di parole dell'irlandese
nello stesso racconto -, era passata presto.
Lei era Lunga ; ma non mi soffermai a farle la corte.

**Annotated text**:
`As I was not staying, but only passing through, I raised my hat to the eleven that played All England for a thousand guineas, and beat them twenty-nine times in ten years. I paid respect also to a couple of exceptionally large yets. After all, I was doing another mans work for him. As I progressed, I began to remember what my favourite author had called him. He had called him lovely and soothing, and delicate. He had called him cool-enfolding and a dark mother. From me to thee, he had said, glad serenades, dances for thee I propose saluting thee. Also vast and well-veild. But somehow I had my doubts. I sat on the grass, and counted a distinct ninety between each beat of my heart. I would have to go slow. Each beat, I saw, puffed out of my breast like purple smoke from an exhaust. I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers. The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick out some low person for my dearest friend.`

**Italian text**:
Poiché non restavo, ma mi limitavo a passare, sollevai
il cappello agl i undici che giocavano contro l'Ali
England per mille ghinee, e vinsero ventinove volte
in dieci anni. Porsi i miei rispetti anche a una coppia
di alberi di tasso straordinariamente grossi . In fondo,
stavo facendo il lavoro di un altro per lui. Mentre
procedevo, cominciai a rammentare come lo aveva
chiamato il mio autore preferito. Lo aveva definito
amabile, rasserenante e delicato. Lo aveva chiamato
fresco-avvolgente e fosca madre. Da me per te, aveva
detto, liete serenate, danze per te propongo in onor
tuo, per te feste e ornamenti. E anche vasto e ben velato.
Per qualche motivo avevo i miei dubbi. Sedetti
sull'erba e contai un secco novanta tra un battito e
l'altro del mio cuore. Avrei dovuto andarci piano. Ciascun
battito, notai, mi gonfiava il petto come il fumo
viola di uno scarico. Ballo con chi balla e bevo con chi
beve. I nostri richiami indecenti echeggiano nell'aria,
come amico più caro mi vado a scegliere un tipaccio.

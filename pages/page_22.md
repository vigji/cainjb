**Annotated text**:
`He always talked to me about murder, when we were alone together. And that day he told me it was the birthday of a good one in prison. John and Cornelius, the Dort people ; I can’t say I understood very much.` John -> the lexicographer?

`But I liked his name, and showed him so, for he had always been very clement to me, even about that cat Jasmine` Clement

`By the bye, Tusitala and Flora had both come over to our place. Of course you might say that was nothing to make a song about. But others had not agreed.`

`And just as I was feeling how much I loved him, he put on funny clothes and went away. I lowered myself and made love to Flora.`

`It was quite late when he came back with her. He had always told me that I was absurdly sensitive. It might be so. Explain it how you will, when I first set eyes on her I felt no vibration, no hint at all, of my latter end. I was banished and slept miserably with Flora.`

He always talked to me about murder, when we
were alone together. And that day he told me it
was the birthday of a good one in prison. John
and Cornelius, the Dort people ; I can’t say I
understood very much. But I liked his name,
and showed him so, for he had always been very
clement to me, even about that cat Jasmine. By
the bye, Tusitala and Flora had both come over
to our place. Of course you might say that was

I loved him, he put on funny clothes and went
away. I lowered myself and made love to Flora.
It was quite late when he came back with her.
He had always told me that I was absurdly
sensitive. It might be so. Explain it how you
will, when I first set eyes on her I felt no
vibration, no hint at all, of my latter end. I was
banished and slept miserably with Flora.

Lui mi parlava sempre di omicidi quando eravamo soli. E quel giorno mi disse che era il compleanno di una brava persona in prigione. Johan e Cornelis, gente di Dort; non posso affermare di aver capito molto. Mi piaceva però il suo nome, e glielo dimostrai perché era sempre stato molto clemente con me, anche a proposito di quella gatta, Jasmine. Per inciso, Tusitala e Flora erano venuti a casa nostra. Si potrebbe dire, natural-mente, che non si tratta di un evento su cui comporre una canzone. Ma altri non erano d'accordo. E, proprio nel momento in cui mi rendevo conto di quanto lo amassi, lui indossò abiti buffi e andò via. Mi accucciai e feci gli occhi dolci a Flora. Era piuttosto tardi quando lui tornò con la donna. Mi aveva sempre detto che ero assurdamente sensibile. Potrebbe anche essere vero.
Spiegatelo come volete, ma la prima volta che la vidi non sentii alcuna vibrazione, nessuna traccia, della fine imminente. Dopo la cacciata, dormii infelice con

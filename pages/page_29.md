**Notes**:


**Annotated text**:
`It had always been my habit to rise with the lark, if there was one going up at about nine. A confirmed botulist, I first arranged with Flora that there should be seven of the long stout shapes rosily bursting from the exquisite, taut but not too elastic brown at breakfast. I trusted they would not taste of Flora and the country-green.`

`Then with whetted appetite, and after an unsatisfactory visit to the spareroom, I went for a quick stroll among my flowers.`

`If the West African ordeal beans had proved a disappointment, at least the broad ones were giving satisfaction. On that day---and indeed I was well inspired---I discarded my useless physostigma.`  Calabar Beans; physostigma

`I led the old mineralogist up the garden, if I may be permitted the expression, and introduced him to my lobelia and to my pretty lords and ladies. I wanted to see how the combination would suit him.`

`I felt I ought to be drawing towards a close ; but one never knew.`

It had always been my habit to rise with the 
lark, if there was one going up at about nine. A 
confirmed botulist, I first arranged with Flora 
that there should be seven of the long stout 
shapes rosily bursting from the exquisite, taut 
but not too elastic brown at breakfast. I trusted 
they would not taste of Flora and the 
country-green. Then with whetted appetite, 
and after an unsatisfactory visit to the 
spareroom, I went for a quick stroll among my 
flowers. If the West African ordeal beans had 
proved a disappointment, at least the broad 
ones were giving satisfaction. On that day---and 
indeed I was well inspired---I discarded my 
useless physostigma. I led the old mineralogist 
up the garden, if I may be permitted the 
expression, and introduced him to my lobelia 
and to my pretty lords and ladies. I wanted to 
see how the combination would suit him. I felt

**Italian text**:

Era sempre stata mia abitudine svegliarmi con il canto del gallo, ammesso che cantasse verso le nove. Apprezzando il botulismo, presi accordi con Flora affinché ci fossero sette di quelle lunghe forme robuste che esplodevano rosee dal raffinato, rigido, ma non troppo elastico marrone a colazione. Confidavo che non avessero il sapore di Flora e del verde della campagna. Poi, stimolato l'appetito, dopo una visita insoddisfacente alla camera degli ospiti, feci una veloce passeggiata tra i fiori. Se i fagioli dell'Africa occidentale mi avevano deluso, almeno quelli grandi davano una certa soddisfazione. Quel giorno - avevo una certa ispirazione - scartai l'inutile physostigma. Condussi in giardino il vecchid mineralista, se mi posso permettere l'espressione, e gli presentai la mia lobelia e i miei graziosi lords e ladies. Volevo capire in che modo la combinazione gli aggradasse. Ebbi la sensazione di avviarmi verso la conclusione; ma non si può mai sapere.

**Annotated text**:
`At my meeting with Clement yesterday, he had been quite specific : less than twenty thousand yards as average---seventeen thousand six hundred to be exact---full ration of the assassin’s wonderful substance, a little act of justice at the end of less than a week, and then the glorious stuff galore for ever.`

`I felt excellent as I took my second pill. At least I was on my way, for I had come upon the major half of a publishing firm ; they had always been very good to me, what with Austin Freeman, Oppenheim and Mary Roberts Rinehart.` [Hodder and Stoughton Little -> Hodder?]

`O my mother was loath to have her go away, all the week she thought of her, she watched for her many a month. And then there was a forgotten line.`

`But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.`

`I thought it a pity that Hodder was not there : what a sweet name for a village!`

`My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes. No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair. I have no chair.`

At my meeting with Clement yesterday, he had
been quite specific : less than twenty thousand
yards as average---seventeen thousand six
hundred to be exact---full ration of the
assassin’s wonderful substance, a little act of
justice at the end of less than a week, and then
the glorious stuff galore for ever. I felt excellent
as I took my second pill. At least I was on my
way, for I had come upon the major half of a
publishing firm ; they had always been very
good to me, what with Austin Freeman,
Oppenheim and Mary Roberts Rinehart. O my
mother was loath to have her go away, all the
week she thought of her, she watched for her
many a month. And then there was a forgotten
line. But the red squaw never came nor was
heard of there again. I thought it a pity that
Hodder was not there : what a sweet name for a
village! My signs are a rain-proof coat, good
shoes. No friend of mine takes his ease in my
chair. I have no chair.

**Italian text**:

All'incontro del giorno prima, Clement era stato abbastanza specifico: mediamente meno di ventimila iarde - diciassettemilaseicento per essere precisi -, una razione completa della meravigliosa sostanza dell'as-sassino, un piccolo atto di giustizia alla fine di nemmeno una settimana, poi gloria in abbondanza per sempre. Presi la seconda pillola e mi sentii benissimo.
Almeno ero sulla strada giusta, perché avevo incontrato la metà più importante di una casa editrice ; erano sempre stati molto gentili con me, così come lo erano stati con Austin Freeman, Oppenheim e Mary Roberts Rinehart. Oh, mia madre fu restia a lasciarla andare, tutta la settimana pensò a lei, per molti mesi l'attese. Poi una riga dimenticata. Ma la squaw pellerossa mai ritornò e di lei più nulla si seppe. Un vero peccato che Hodder non fosse qui ; che dolce nome per un villaggio! Le mie insegne sono un pastrano a prova di pioggia e buone scarpe. Nessun amico s'ac-comoda sulla mia poltrona. Non ho nessuna poltrona.

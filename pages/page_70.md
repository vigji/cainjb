**Annotated text**:
```
It flashed through my mind that the place 
between Eros and the Queens Hall had 
horribly changed since Orpen painted it in 1912, 
also that even if I took the warnings of the 
Ming and got there instantaneously, my modest 
Munich would have to bracket, at my expense, 
with islands more correctly known as Efate. 
BNut after all I was not going. Rather I 
intended to finish what I had begun. The girl 
would find it in the morning, franked, and all 
ready to go upon its way. I had told all I knew, 
and felt very tired. Would he ignore what I had 
said, leaving me to do my worst? And if so, 
what worst could I do? Or would he come to 
me and cringe for silence, relying on our old 
association, when he had babbled at me knee, 
the arthritic one, that surely the cabbage 
butterflies were fragments of a poem God had 
written and, as being too good for us, torn up? 
Or would he simply try to do me in?

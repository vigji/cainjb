`Or would he come to me and cringe for silence, relying on our old association, when he had babbled at me knee, the arthritic one, that surely the cabbage butterflies were fragments of a poem God had written and, as being too good for us, torn up? Or would he simply try to do me in?`

BNut after all I was not going. Rather I 
intended to finish what I had begun. The girl 
would find it in the morning, franked, and all 
ready to go upon its way. I had told all I knew, 
and felt very tired. Would he ignore what I had 
said, leaving me to do my worst? And if so, 
what worst could I do? Or would he come to

**Italian text**:

Mi passò per la testa che il luogo tra Eros e la Queen's Hall era orribilmente cambiato da quando Orpen lo aveva dipinto nel 1912 e che, anche se avessi volato sulle ali dell'aurora e l'avessi raggiunto all'istante, la mia modesta München si sarebbe dovuta abbinare, a mie spese, con fette sottili di pane e formaggio. Ma in fondo non ci sarei andata. Intendevo finire quello che avevo cominciato. La ragazza l'avrebbe trovata al mattino, affrancata e pronta per essere spedita. Avevo detto tutto ciò che sapevo e sentivo la stanchezza. Lui avrebbe ignorato ciò che avevo detto, lasciandomi a fare del mio peggio? E, in quel caso, che cosa di peggio avrei potuto fare? Oppure sarebbe venuto da me e si sarebbe mostrato servile in cambio del silenzio, facendo affidamento sulla nostra vecchia associazione, quando lui aveva balbettato al mio ginocchio, quello artritico, che di certo le farfalle dei cavoli erano frammenti di un poema scritto da Dio che lo aveva strappato, poiché di qualità troppo elevata per noi? Oppure lui avrebbe semplicemente provato a farmi fuori?

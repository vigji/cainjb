`He had read out about some most excellent potent brilliant eyes, swift-darting as the stars, steadfast as the sun ; grey, we said, of the azure-grey colour ; large enough, not of glaring size ; the habitual expression of them vigilance and penetrating sense, rapidity resting on depth. When she asked him why he had chosen those and whose they were, he answered : Father Freds, and because it was closing day in Potsdam.` "Most excellent potent brilliant eyes, swift-darting as the stars, steadfast as the sun; gray, we said, of the azure-gray colour; large enough, not of glaring size; the habitual expression of them vigilance and penetrating sense, rapidity resting on depth" Carlyle writing about Frederick the Great, dead 17th August in Potsdam

`I had had a dry shampoo that morning, a thing I adored, especially on the old chest. Rather a waste of time, though, as it turned out.`

`Of course I ought to have been more careful of such a trifle. Suddenly I felt that I had put my foot in it. Still I had three more left.`

And she wore a mauve love-knot on her breast, 
and the ends were unequal. He said hed put 
that right, but he couldn't find the silly old 
jossers, as Jasmine might so easily have called 
them. I was old enough to remember her ; she 
wasnt the one Id killed. He had read out about 
some most excellent potent brilliant eyes, 
swift-darting as the stars, steadfast as the sun ; 
grey, we said, of the azure-grey colour ; large 
enough, not of glaring size ; the habitual 
expression of them vigilance and penetrating 
sense, rapidity resting on depth. When she 
asked him why he had chosen those and whose 
they were, he answered : Father Freds, and 
because it was closing day in Potsdam. I had 
had a dry shampoo that morning, a thing I 
adored, especially on the old chest. Rather a 
waste of time, though, as it turned out. Of 
course I ought to have been more careful of 
such a trifle. Suddenly I felt that I had put my 
foot in it. Still I had three more left.

**Italian text**:

E sul petto aveva un nodo d'amore color lavanda, e i due capi non erano uguali. Lui disse che l'avrebbe sistemato, ma non riuscì a trovare le care, vecchie forfici, come le avrebbe probabilmente chiamate Jasmine. La mia età mi consentiva ricordarla ; non era lei quella che avevo ucciso. Lui aveva letto ad alta voce di occhi straordinariamente potenti e brillanti, che si muovono rapidi come stelle, fermi come il sole ; grigi, si è detto, di un colore grigio-azzurro ; abbastanza grandi, non troppo abbaglianti ; l'espressione abituale è di vigilanza e sono penetranti, la rapidità si basa sulla profondità. Quando lei gli chiese come mai avesse scelto quelli e di chi fossero, lui rispose : di Padre Fred, e perché era l'ultimo giorno a Potsdam. Quel mattino avevo usato lo shampoo secco, una cosa che adoravo, in particolare sul vecchio petto. Fu però una perdita di tempo, alla fine dei conti. Certo avrei dovuto prestare maggiore attenzione a una sciocchezza come quella. All'improvviso mi accorsi di aver fatto un passo falso. Avrei dovuto prestare più attenzione ai successivi .

**Annotated text**:
`One’s eyebrows were one’s own, I always thought. Though I did remember a case---Aunt Mary’s, to be precise---when it was not so. She had met him after the explosion, of course ; and when it became a question of dinner and the Highgate Empire, actually with performing quaggas, she put herself in the hands of the man who made up for, if anything could make up for, the Russian ballet. And they dropped, naturally, like two fuzzy caterpillars into the clear soup at supper. The old days. The Highgate Empire, where Wilkie Bard, as Lauder did not say, sang o’ his love and fondly sae did I o’ mine. At last the two little horrors ceased in their shrill claim and counter-claim for sweaty quasi-transparencies of colour, and goggled at me while I put black to mine. Bill always called them two dark flapper moons. Should I make an effort and go back to Henry? He was ready to love. That at least was obvious.`

One’s eyebrows were one’s own, I always
thought. Though I did remember a case---Aunt
Mary’s, to be precise---when it was not so. She
had met him after the explosion, of course ; and
when it became a question of dinner and the
Highgate Empire, actually with performing
quaggas, she put herself in the hands of the man
who made up for, if anything could make up
for, the Russian ballet. And they dropped,
naturally, like two fuzzy caterpillars into the
clear soup at supper. The old days. The
Highgate Empire, where Wilkie Bard, as Lauder
did not say, sang o’ his love and fondly sae did I
o’ mine. At last the two little horrors ceased in
their shrill claim and counter-claim for sweaty
quasi-transparencies of colour, and goggled at
me while I put black to mine. Bill always called
them two dark flapper moons. Should I make
an effort and go back to Henry? He was ready

**Italian text**:
Da sempre pensavo che le sopracciglia fossero uniche da persona a persona. Anche se rammento un caso - per essere precisi quello di zia Mary - in cui le cose non stavano così. Certo, lei lo aveva incontrato dopo l'esplosione; e quando divenne una questione di cena e Highgate Empire, con veri quagga che si esibivano, lei si mise nelle mani dell'uomo che aveva rimediato, ammesso che a qualcosa potesse rimediare, ai Balletti rus-si. E, come è naturale, caddero come due bruchi pelosi, nel brodo chiaro a pranzo. I vecchi tempi. Lo Highgate Empire, dove Wilkie Bard, come non disse Lauder, cantava del suo amore e teneramente cantavo anch'io del mio. Alla fine i due piccoli orrori smisero di urlare e di esigere e controesigere viscide semitrasparenze colorate, e mi guardarono stralunati mentre mettevo il nero sulle mie. Bill le ha sempre definite due lune scure da flapper. Dovrei sforzarmi di tornare da Henry?
Lui era pronto per l'amore. Almeno quello era ovvio.

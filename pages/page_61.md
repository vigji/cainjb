**Notes**:



**Annotated text**:

`I had always been proud of my namesake, the Great Lexicographer, as we, not unnaturally,  called him in the family. But I wondered if part of my life would not rather horribly reverse his. After all he had been born at Colney Hatch.` Great Lexicographer -> another clerihew talking about Samuel Johnson,  the author of A Dictionary of the English Language. Born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. 
But maybe it's John Walker, born in Colney Hatch.

`But no, for the goal of my pilgrimage might easily make it Broadmoor; I rather hated that portmanteau of Dartmoor and Broad arrows, 
with a little insanity thrown in. `

`No, locked in, locked in! William the Schoolman---how like an old war song!---was of that place, and, in spite of Rysbrachs statues of the first Lord  King, it was charming.`


`Le couchant dardait ses rayons suprmes et le vent berait les nnuphars blmes ; les grands nnuphars entre les roseaux tristement luisaient sur les calmes eaux.`
The setting sun cast its supreme rays, and the wind cradled the pale water lilies; the great water lilies, among the reeds, glistened sadly on the calm waters.

`Doctor Invincibilis, dear old Bill, he was no mean psychologist ; he had a razor.` Occam's razor (Doctor Invincibilis)

`There I saw a hen and two sheep.` 

`It was a pity about Dickens/insane jealousy of chickens,/and one could really almost weep/at his morbid mistrust of sheep.`  Edmund Clerihew Bentley, humorous clerihew cited verbatim.

**Italian text**:
```
Avevo sempre nutrito un certo orgoglio per il mio omonimo, il Grande Lessicografo, come lo chiamavamo in famiglia, e non in maniera innaturale. Ma mi chiedevo se parte della mia vita non avrebbe orribilmente ribaltato la sua. Dopotutto, lui era nato a
Colney Hatch. Ma no, poiché la meta del mio pellegrinaggio poteva facilmente diventare Broadmoor ; odiavo l'idea: una parola macedonia di Dartmoor e frecce di Broad, con un pizzico di follia in più. No, reclusa, reclusa! William the Schoolman - sembrava proprio una vecchia canzone di guerra! - veniva da lì e, a dispetto delle statue di Rysbrach del primo Lord King, era un luogo affascinante. Le couchant dardait ses rayons suprêmes et le vent berçait les nénuphars blêmes; les grands nénuphars entre les roseaux, triste-ment luisaient sur les calmes eaux. Doctor Invincibilis, il caro vecchio Bill, non era uno psicologo da poco ; aveva un rasoio. Poi vidi una gallina e due pecore. Un vero peccato. Con il pollo, Dickens non aveva auto-controllo, con le pecore le sue maniere erano becere.

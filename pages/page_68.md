**Annotated text**:
`Out cascaded the darling young. It was no tragedy ; that was, no tragedy comparable with the fire here in the Latham Chapel in 1906.`
 Selby, North Yorkshire

`Yet, I supposed, to wantonly look back like that buttered no parsnips.`

`Just like reverting to old tunes after they were damned and dead : how often had I not caught myself whistling Alexanders Ragtime Wedding Feast in my frugal bath.`

`I felt that Henry was about all I could hope to cope with, or with whom, if you like, I could hope to cope.`

`I was the more fed up, therefore, with the incursion of an untidy fellow, a myopic-looking creature, who clumsily stepped on my foot and touched a chord of memory at the same time.`

`Surely this has eavesdropped at my last crucial meeting with the old man. It mattered little enough, of course.`

`But that sort of thing was like a mosquito about the ears, making Kreisler on his little fiddle. It distracted.` Kreisler austrian violinist

Out cascaded the darling young. It was no 
tragedy ; that was, no tragedy comparable with 
the fire here in the Latham Chapel in 1906. Yet, 
I supposed, to wantonly look back like that 
buttered no parsnips. Just like reverting to old 
tunes after they were damned and dead : how 
often had I not caught myself whistling 
Alexanders Ragtime Wedding Feast in my 
frugal bath. I felt that Henry was about all I 
could hope to cope with, or with whom, if you 
like, I could hope to cope. I was the more fed 
up, therefore, with the incursion of an untidy 
fellow, a myopic-looking creature, who 
clumsily stepped on my foot and touched a 
chord of memory at the same time. Surely this 
has eavesdropped at my last crucial meeting 
with the old man. It mattered little enough, of 
course. But that sort of thing was like a 
mosquito about the ears, making Kreisler on his 
little fiddle. It distracted.

**Italian text**:
Il caro giovane capitombolò fuori. Non fu una tragedia
; ovvero, non fu una tragedia paragonabile all'incendio
avvenuto qui, nella Cappella di Latham, nel
1906. Eppure, immaginavo, guardarsi indietro così
licenziosamente non indorava la pillola. Proprio come
tornare alle vecchie canzoni quando erano morte e
sepolte : quanto spesso nel mio bagno frugale avevo
rischiato di fischiettare Alexander's Ragtime Wedding
Feast. Avevo la sensazione che Henry fosse tutto quello
che potevo sperare di sopportare o - se volete - di
affrontare. Quindi mi seccò ancora di più l'incursione
di un tizio tutto in disordine, una creatura all'apparenza
miope che mi pestò goffamente un piede e,
al contempo, toccò una corda della memoria. Di sicuro
aveva ascoltato di nascosto il mio ultimo, cruciale
incontro con il vecchio. Certo, non aveva molta
importanza. Ma alcune cose somigliavano a una
zanzara che ti ronza intorno alle orecchie, suonando
un Kreisler con il suo piccolo violino. Distraevano.

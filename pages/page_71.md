**Annotated text**:
`But next day that religious fellows head drapery, if I might thus unscientifically express myself, showed signs, it seemed to me, after that initial success, of failing. I would give it till midnight.` Monk's hood
 
`Do not misunderstand me. Why should I not play the Spartan mother with emotion, be the Lucius Junius Brutus of my kind? `

`I thought of May. Over them came old odour of red May. Lovely, indeed, but not appropriate. I felt that I was letting May down.`

`As for the other, I had, of course, no intention of letting up. Henry, before our tea of anchovy toast and various hot dishes (I was never a stinter) riotously displayed himself all over me.`

`He hit me once full in the eye, and I remembered, I could not help remembering, Elsies difficulty when the young coastguard had tried to prove to her his direct descent from Herebald the Drake.` Herebeald – the son of the Geatish king Hreðel. Beowulf was his nephew. Funny ref to Herebald the Drake [in _The Complete Sportsman_, by Harry Graham](https://ia800900.us.archive.org/25/items/completesportsma00grah/completesportsma00grah.pdf)

`I will, she quoted, express my duty in his eye.`  _Hamlet_:"[Enter Fortinbras at the head of a Norwegian army with one of his captains at his side]
Go, captain, from me, greet the Danish King. / Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras/ Claims the conveyance of a promised march/ Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous./ If that his majesty would aught with us,/ We shall express our duty in his eye;/ And let him know so."

**Italian text**:

Ma il giorno seguente il cappuccio del monaco, se posso esprimermi in maniera così poco scientifica, mi sembrò mostrare segni di cedimento dopo il successo iniziale. Gli avrei concesso fino a mezzanotte. Non mi fraintendete. Perché non dovrei interpretare con emozione la madre spartana, essere il Lucius lunius Brutus del mio genere? Pensai a May. Su di essi scese l'antico odore della rossa maggio. Gradevole, certo, ma non appropriato. Avevo la sensazione di deludere
May. Quanto all'altro, non avevo certo intenzione di cedere. Henry, prima del nostro tè con panini all'acciuga e vari piatti caldi (la frugalità non è il mio for-te), si mostrò molto sfrenato. Mi colpì una volta in pieno occhio, e rammentai, non potei fare a meno di rammentare, la difficoltà di Elsie quando la giovane guardia costiera aveva cercato di dimostrarle di essere discendente diretto di Herebald the Drake. «Gli presenterò i miei omaggi davanti agli occhi» citò lei.

`The ancient had then sat down among the heather to a great dish of brown and swimming collops.`

`Personally, as far as my stomach went, I could not love the deer so much, loved I not on a moor, with concomitant Spey Royal to drown the taste.`

`Nor was that likely to happen in this case. The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.`

`Circumstances, I thought, as I looked over at the man, alter cases. I would give the rogue a chance. Have you a good memory? I asked. Intermittent but long, he answered. That signed his death warrant.`

`Well, signatures were his business. The gold was being cleared out of the light ; the remaining silver was, how shall I say?, unsatisfactory. I also had flaunted the panache---it lay at that moment beneath my lips---to the public without ever having been satisfied with it. `

**Italian text**:
Il vecchio si era poi seduto tra l'erica davanti a un
grande piatto di carne scura che nuotava nel sugo.
Personalmente, per il mio stomaco, non riuscivo ad
apprezzare molto il cervo, né nella brughiera né con
lo Spey Royal per camuffare il gusto. Né era possibile
che accadesse in questo caso. L'assenza di vecchi
amici si può anche sopportare con rassegnazione. Ma
la separazione da qualcuno al quale si sia stati appena
presentati, per quanto breve, è quasi intollerabile.
Mentre guardavo l'uomo pensai che a estremi mali
c'erano estremi rimedi. Avrei dato una possibilità a
quel furfa nte. << Ha buona memoria ? » chiesi. << lntermittente,
ma lunga » rispose. Questo firmò la sua condanna
a morte. Be', in fondo, le firme erano il suo lavoro.
L'oro si stava ripulendo dalla luce ; l'argento che
restava era, come dire, insoddisfacente . L'avevo anche
ostentato in pubblico, senza mai trame soddisfazione.

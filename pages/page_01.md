**Annotated text**:
`I sit down alone at the appointed table and take up my pen to give all whom it may con- cern an exact account of what may happen.`

`Call me nervous, call me fey, if you will; at least this little pen, this mottled black and silver Aquarius, with its nib specially tempered to my order in Amsterdam, is greedy.`

`It has not had much work since it flew so nimbly for the dead old man.`

`As I watch the sea, Casy Ferris passes with down-dropped eyes.`

`Of course, to-day is the day. Her father reminds me of a valetudinarian walrus. But she has, I suppose, to have somebody.` 

`St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine is full, no doubt, already.` Lazarus' Church (Portuguese: Igreja de São Lázaro) is a historic church in São Lázaro, Macau, China. Built between 1557 and 1560??

`I think she is rash ; but it is none of my business. Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying, my heart remembers how.`

`Strange that he comes into my head so much to-day. I hope it’s over some flotsam fish that the birds are making whau-pee. But all the nice gulls love a sailor. Ugh.`

I sit down alone at the appointed table and take
up my pen to give all whom it may con- cern an
exact account of what may happen. Call me
nervous, call me fey, if you will; at least this
little pen, this mottled black and silver
Aquarius, with its nib specially tempered to my
order in Amsterdam, is greedy. It has not had
much work since it flew so nimbly for the dead
old man. As I watch the sea, Casy Ferris passes
with down-dropped eyes. Of course, to-day is
the day. Her father reminds me of a valetudi-
narian walrus. But she has, I suppose, to have
somebody. St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine is full,
no doubt, already. I think she is rash ; but it
is none of my business. Where about the graves
of the martyrs the whaups are crying, my heart
remembers how. Strange that he comes into
my head so much to-day. I hope it’s over some
flotsam fish that the birds are making whau-
pee. But all the nice gulls love a sailor. Ugh.

**Italian text**:

Siedo in solitudine al tavolo stabilito e prendo la penna per comunicare a tutti i possibili interessati l'esatto resoconto di ciò che potrebbe accadere. Imputatelo pure al nervosismo, alla stranezza, se volete; ma almeno questa piccola penna, questa Aquarius nera maculata d'argento, con il pennino appositamente realizzato ad Amsterdam su mio ordine, è avida. Non ha lavorato molto da quando scivolava svelta per il vecchio mor-to. Mentre osservo il mare, Casy Ferris passa a occhi bassi. Certo, oggi è il giorno. Suo padre mi rammenta un tricheco ipocondriaco, ma immagino che lei debba avere qualcuno. St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine, senza dub-bio, è già piena. Penso che lei sia sconsiderata ; ma non sono fatti miei. Dove i chiurli piangono intorno alle tombe dei martiri, il mio cuore rammenta come.
Strano che pensi tanto a lui oggi. Spero che gli uccelli stiano facendo baccano per qualche pesce che galleg-gia. Ma tutti i bravi gabbiani amano i marinai. Ugh.

**Annotated text**:
`She said it didnt matter what they had done, because she was still an M.D., and shed got another one. That was he. She showed us some delicate undercoats, all raw liver colour, very lovely, and proved it. But she had, too, a passion for getting new things, and I was sorry for his sake.`

`After all, in all my life with him, I had only had one coat, and that an inherited one. True, it was long and graceful, and fitted beautifully, which was more than could be said for some of hers.`

`Combe, I had always thought, was where one pottered after rabbits. But there was a George too, because he said so. He called him a Free Knowledgist, though it didnt seem to me he gave much away. He said this was his last day.`

`I didnt care. But I heard them say they were two all for that year ; she said one of his was vicarious and I could not understand what the vicar had to do with it. They made a bet.`

She said it didnt matter what they had done, 
because she was still an M.D., and shed got 
another one. That was he. She showed us some 
delicate undercoats, all raw liver colour, very 
lovely, and proved it. But she had, too, a passion 
for getting new things, and I was sorry for his 
sake. After all, in all my life with him, I had 
only had one coat, and that an inherited one. 
True, it was long and graceful, and fitted 
beautifully, which was more than could be said 
for some of hers. Combe, I had always thought, 
was where one pottered after rabbits. But there 
was a George too, because he said so. He called 
him a Free Knowledgist, though it didnt seem 
to me he gave much away. He said this was his 
last day. I didnt care. But I heard them say they 
were two all for that year ; she said one of his 
was vicarious and I could not understand what 
the vicar had to do with it. They made a bet.

**Italian text**:
Lei disse che i risultati non erano importanti, perché
lei era ancora M.D. e ne aveva preso un altro. Vale
a dire lui. Ci mostrò alcuni toni delicati, tutti color
fegato crudo, molto carini, e li provò. Ma aveva anche
una passione per prendere cose nuove, e mi dispiacque
per lui. In fondo, in tutta la mia vita con lui,
avevo ricevuto un solo cappotto, ed era ereditato. È
vero che era lungo ed elegante, e mi andava benissimo,
che era più di quanto si potesse dire per alcuni
di quelli di lei. Combe, avevo sempre pensato, era
dove si dava la caccia ai conigli. Ma c'era anche un
George, perché lui aveva detto così . Lo definiva frenologo,
anche se non capivo cos'avesse a che fare
con i freni. Lui disse che era il suo ultimo giorno. A
me non interessava. Ma li sentii dire che erano due
pari per quell'anno ; lei ribatté che lui aveva fatto
ricorso a un aiuto esterno e io non riuscivo a capire
cosa avesse rincorso. Avevano fatto una scommessa.

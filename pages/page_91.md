**Italian text**:
In gioventù mi preoccupava portare lo stesso nome dell'ammiraglio di Newbolt e dello sbirro di Shakespeare e mi aveva irritato, da studente, essere conosciuto come l'Uomo che ride e sotto il manto ci ha il coltello. Poi trovai più comodo nella pratica accentare la mia terza lettera. Il giorno dopo la rucola blu stava ancora stillando ;in effetti sapevo troppo per !asciarla affiorare. Sembrò avere successo. L'ammantata di neve dilettante, dalla mano delicata ? Almeno ero l'ultimo. E non direi che da ultimo ero da meno. Cercai di interessarlo al mio piccolo Museo Nero e in effetti suscitai un frisson nell'occhio rimasto del noto e rispettato Cadaver Charlie. L'occhio nel quale, subito prima che il detective di Chicago sparasse all'altro, lui aveva chiesto a quel detective gentiluomo se lui, il detective, riuscisse a vedere del verde. Tuttavia sembrava che Henry si fosse divertito con questo reperto. Avrei dovuto prendere provvedimenti.

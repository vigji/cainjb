**Italian text**:

Era sempre stata mia abitudine svegliarmi con il canto del gallo, ammesso che cantasse verso le nove. Apprezzando il botulismo, presi accordi con Flora affinché ci fossero sette di quelle lunghe forme robuste che esplodevano rosee dal raffinato, rigido, ma non troppo elastico marrone a colazione. Confidavo che non avessero il sapore di Flora e del verde della campagna. Poi, stimolato l'appetito, dopo una visita insoddisfacente alla camera degli ospiti, feci una veloce passeggiata tra i fiori. Se i fagioli dell'Africa occidentale mi avevano deluso, almeno quelli grandi davano una certa soddi-sfazione. Quel giorno - avevo una certa ispirazione - scartai l'inutile physostigma. Condussi in giardino il vecchio mineralista, se mi posso permettere l'espressione, e gli presentai la mia lobelia e i miei graziosi lords e ladies. Volevo capire in che modo la combinazione gli aggradasse. Ebbi la sensazione di avviarmi verso la conclusione; ma non si può mai sapere.

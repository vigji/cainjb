**Annotated text**:
`He stood and looked down at me ; but I was not to be hurried. The money changed hands slowly ; for I wished to be able to describe him. He seems to have had a great confidence in the opinion of his physicians. I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. But there were doctors and doctors, I would have to think seriously of that. And then he went. He went. Simple faith or Norman bluff? But that Douglas was, perhaps, less tender and more true. My heart dilated as soon as the sedulous ape had got out from me. Gone, in a relative sense alas! not positively, finally gone. That was a consummation devoutly to be wished, but yet to be compassed. Whom should I trust with that? I thought of May. May be. May be not.`

Sunset was already reddish-purple above the 
Quarry hills, like a bruise on the breast of the 
evening.

**Italian text**:

Lui si raddrizzò e mi squadrò ; ma io non mi feci mettere fretta. Il denaro cambiò mano lentamente ; perché io desideravo poter descrivere l'uomo. Aveva troppa fiducia nell'opinione dei medici. Comunque, mi rallegro che finalmente si sia deciso, e abbia seguito il parere dei medici. Ma c'erano medici e medici, avrei dovuto pensarci seriamente. Poi se ne andò. Via . Semplice fede o una finta alla Normanna? Ma quel Douglas, forse, era meno tenero e più sincero. Il mio cuore si aprì non appena la scimmia diligente uscì da me. Uscì in senso relativo, purtroppo! Non assoluto, non se ne andò del tutto. È un consummatum da invocare a mani giunte, ma che deve ancora essere raggiunto. A chi lo dovrei affidare? Pensai a May. Forse May. Forse non May. Il sole era già rosso porpora sopra le colline del Quarry, come un livido sul seno della sera.

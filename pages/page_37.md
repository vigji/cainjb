**Annotated text**:
```
Deaths clumsy fingered, that was the really 
frightful thing : I had seen them, beneath a 
debonair smile, fumbling so long about their 
business. I realised that I would have to do 
something. This time, of course, the male 
incarcerated at the place of Hotspurs death 
could not hear. I looked across the table to the 
great brimming bowl of yellow jasmine ; young 
Alexander had sent him up the night before 
with an invitation to a private view of the 
Paulo Post Avorticists. Then I glanced at the 
rococo mirror on my left. Well, my parents had 
seen to it, soon after birth, that I should be one 
; but I had never, save during that week in 
Malta when I met Ronald Firbank and was a 
trifle jaundiced, been the other. It was terrible 
to sit there with only the table in front of me, 
and to know that murder had been committed. 
He would---I had sensed that---be intrinsicated 
and concealed, chamber within chamber ; if I 
durst open the bores, who would believe me?

**Annotated text**:
`Deaths clumsy fingered, that was the really frightful thing : I had seen them, beneath a debonair smile, fumbling so long about their business. I realised that I would have to do something.`

`This time, of course, the male incarcerated at the place of Hotspurs death could not hear.` Sir Henry Percy KG, nicknamed Hotspur or Harry Hotspur. Died in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England

`I looked across the table to the great brimming bowl of yellow jasmine; young Alexander had sent him up the night before with an invitation to a private view of the Paulo Post Avorticists.`

`Then I glanced at the rococo mirror on my left. Well, my parents had seen to it, soon after birth, that I should be one; but I had never, save during that week in Malta when I met Ronald Firbank and was a trifle jaundiced, been the other.` English novelist.

`It was terrible to sit there with only the table in front of me, and to know that murder had been committed. He would---I had sensed that---be intrinsicated and concealed, chamber within chamber ; if I durst open the bores, who would believe me?`

Deaths clumsy fingered, that was the really 
frightful thing : I had seen them, beneath a 
debonair smile, fumbling so long about their 
business. I realised that I would have to do 
something. This time, of course, the male 
incarcerated at the place of Hotspurs death 
could not hear. I looked across the table to the 
great brimming bowl of yellow jasmine ; young 
Alexander had sent him up the night before 
with an invitation to a private view of the 
Paulo Post Avorticists. Then I glanced at the 
rococo mirror on my left. Well, my parents had 
seen to it, soon after birth, that I should be one 
; but I had never, save during that week in 
Malta when I met Ronald Firbank and was a 
trifle jaundiced, been the other. It was terrible 
to sit there with only the table in front of me, 
and to know that murder had been committed. 
He would---I had sensed that---be intrinsicated 
and concealed, chamber within chamber ; if I 
durst open the bores, who would believe me?

**Italian text**:

Morte e le sue goffe dita. Ecco cos'era davvero spaventoso: le avevo viste, dietro un sorriso affabile, brancolare a lungo affaccendate. Mi resi conto di dover fare qualcosa. Questa volta, come è ovvio, l'uomo incarcerato nel luogo della morte di Hotspur non poteva sen-tire. Osservai al di là del tavolo il grande vaso colmo di gelsomini gialli; il giovane Alexander li aveva mandati la sera prima con un invito a una visione privata dei Vorticisti paulo-post. Poi guardai lo specchio rococò alla mia sinistra. Bene, poco dopo la nascita, i miei genitori avevano fatto in modo che non ce ne fosse un'al-tra; ma io, a parte quella settimana a Malta durante la quale incontrai Ronald Firbank e provai un po' di invidia, mai fui l'altra. Era terribile starmene a sedere
Ii, con solo il tavolo davanti a me, e sapere che era stato commesso un omicidio. Lui - lo avevo percepito - sarebbe stato coinvolto e nascosto, una camera dentro l'altra; se spalancassi le porte, chi mi crederebbe?

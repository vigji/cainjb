**Annotated text**:
`In one way, of course, I was glad they were married. I had always been rather a stickler for purity in family life.`

`That scandalous rumour of a Maltese landing on our island and seducing an ancestress of mine---or was it an ancestor?---from the path of duty, I never had and never would believe.` Yorkshire Terrier? Dog breeding with Maltese among the ancestors

`If I had had a real education, instead of just listening to him, I could have told---it was bad that day---how I detested being called Hal. It was she that did it. `

`But he was pleased in a way, and said to her, out of a book, the original ground of the transaction appears to have been sentimental: He was my friend, says the murderous doctor; he was dear to me.` [Thomas de Quincey, _second paper on murder_](https://www.authorama.com/miscellaneous-essays-2.html)
The pollinctor, you are aware, was a person whose business it was to dress and prepare dead bodies for burial. The original ground of the transaction appears to have been sentimental: ’He was my friend,’ says the murderous doctor; ’he was dear to me,’ in speaking of the pollinctor. 

`Some Tom, not the one I killed in the matter of Jasmine, had done that, I gathered.` Thomas de Quincey; dog killed Tom?

`He was enthusiastic and provided a chop for me, and said it was good he had visited England to-day for the first time.`

In one way, of course, I was glad they were 
married. I had always been rather a stickler for 
purity in family life. That scandalous rumour of 
a Maltese landing on our island and seducing 
an ancestress of mine---or was it an 
ancestor?---from the path of duty, I never had 
and never would believe. If I had had a real 
education, instead of just listening to him, I 
could have told---it was bad that day---how I 
detested being called Hal. It was she that did it. 
But he was pleased in a way, and said to her, out 
of a book, the original ground of the 
transaction appears to have been sentimental : 
He was my friend, says the murderous doctor 
; he was dear to me. Some Tom, not the one I 
killed in the matter of Jasmine, had done that, I 
gathered. He was enthusiastic and provided a 
chop for me, and said it was good he had visited 
England to-day for the first time.

**Italian text**:

Sotto un certo aspetto, ovviamente, ero felice che fossero sposati. Da sempre tenevo molto alla purezza nella vita di famiglia . Non avevo creduto, né mai lo avrei fatto, a quella scandalosa voce riguardo l'arrivo sulla nostra isola di un Maltese che aveva distolto una mia antenata - o si trattava di un antenato ? - dalla strada del dovere. Se avessi avuto una vera educazione, anziché !imitarmi ad ascoltare lui, avrei potuto dire - era proprio un brutto giorno, quello - quanto detestassi essere chiamato Hal. Era stata lei a farlo. Ma lui, in un certo senso, era soddisfatto e le disse, leggendo da un libro, che il motivo originario della transazione sembra sia stato sentimentale : " Lui era mio amico" dice il medico assassino ; "Mi era caro " . Qualche Tom, non quello che ho ucciso per la faccenda di Jasmine, lo aveva fatto, da quanto avevo colto. Era entusiasta e mi procurò una braciola e disse che era bello che oggi avesse visitato l'Inghilterra per la prima volta.

**Annotated text**:
```
I was a little consoled for the weeping weather 
by the fact that Gainsborough had gone out 
to-day. And, now I came to think of it, Henry 
had also gone to-day ; poor Henry, who had 
stayed uncomfortably after his meeting with 
Clment yesterday. Henceforth I ask not good 
fortune, I myself am good fortune, I changed. 
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no 
more, need nothing, done with indoor 
complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms. But 
that would be scanned. Or rather it wouldnt. It 
didnt seem to fit. I had woken that morning 
pleasantly near the sea, at yesterdays capricious 
place of appointment with the man who gave 
me my instructions and all I wanted beside. Did 
Wodehouse know it, I wondered. Of its Earl he 
had said that he stood gazing out over his 
domain, drooping like a wet sock, as was his 
habit when he had nothing to prop his spine 
against. All I wanted beside, I had thought. 
Hadnt Chesterton said something about its 
being hemp at both ends? My job might prove 
him right.

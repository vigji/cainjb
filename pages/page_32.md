**Annotated text**:
`I was a little consoled for the weeping weather by the fact that Gainsborough had gone out to-day.` Thomas Gainsborough, dead 2 August 1788

`And, now I came to think of it, Henry had also gone to-day ; poor Henry, who had stayed uncomfortably after his meeting with Clment yesterday.`

`Henceforth I ask not good fortune, I myself am good fortune, I changed. Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing, done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms.`

`But that would be scanned. Or rather it wouldnt. It didnt seem to fit. I had woken that morning pleasantly near the sea, at yesterdays capricious place of appointment with the man who gave me my instructions and all I wanted beside.`

`Did Wodehouse know it, I wondered. Of its Earl he had said that he stood gazing out over his domain, drooping like a wet sock, as was his habit when he had nothing to prop his spine against. All I wanted beside, I had thought. Hadnt Chesterton said something about its being hemp at both ends? My job might prove him right.`

I was a little consoled for the weeping weather 
by the fact that Gainsborough had gone out 
to-day. And, now I came to think of it, Henry 
had also gone to-day ; poor Henry, who had 
stayed uncomfortably after his meeting with 
Clment yesterday. Henceforth I ask not good 
fortune, I myself am good fortune, I changed. 
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no 
more, need nothing, done with indoor 
complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms. But 
that would be scanned. Or rather it wouldnt. It 
didnt seem to fit. I had woken that morning 
pleasantly near the sea, at yesterdays capricious 
place of appointment with the man who gave 
me my instructions and all I wanted beside. Did 
Wodehouse know it, I wondered. Of its Earl he 
had said that he stood gazing out over his 
domain, drooping like a wet sock, as was his 
habit when he had nothing to prop his spine 
against. All I wanted beside, I had thought. 
Hadnt Chesterton said something about its 
being hemp at both ends? My job might prove 
him right.

**Italian text**:
Mi consolai un poco per la pioggia pensando che oggi Gainsborough era morto. E, ripensandoci, anche Henry; povero Henry, che era rimasto a disagio dopo il suo incontro del giorno prima con Clément. Di qui in avanti non invoco la buona sorte, sono io stesso la buona sorte, cantavo. Di qui in avanti non piagnucolo più, non rimando più, non ho bisogno di niente.
Basta con le lagne fra le quattro mura di casa, basta con le biblioteche, con le critiche querule. Ma questo sarebbe stato esaminato. O, meglio, non l'avrebbero fatto. Non sembrava adeguato. Il risveglio di quel mattino era stato piacevole, vicino al mare, nel capriccioso luogo dell'appuntamento del giorno prima, con l'uomo che mi dava istruzioni oltre a tutto quello che volevo. Mi chiesi se Wodehouse sapesse. Del suo Conte aveva detto che restava in piedi a fissare il suo dominio, floscio come un calzino bagnato, com'era sua abitudine quando non aveva un posto dove appoggiare la schiena. Tutto quello che volevo, avevo pensato. Chesterton non aveva forse detto qualcosa sul fatto che si comincia e si finisce con la canapa?
Il mio lavoro poteva dimostrare che aveva ragione.

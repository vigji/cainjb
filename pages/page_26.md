**Annotated text**:
`The girl had left Henry by this time, thank God. She was an obvious whey-face. She didnt seem capable for a moment of understanding those first two killings of his. He was being a dear. He had sent the rectors aunt away, as he explained to the girl, like a bee with a sore bonnet. A foreign touch. Killing time, yes. I was doing that. It was funny how idly the mind worked ; or seeming idly. Perhaps there was something in heredity after all. I pondered to its direction. An accent was a terrible thing, I thought. Killing time wouldnt be so good. I realised that I was impressionable, that I liked a good murder. But Hodge, once settled, wasnt in the least like a singer. He had a wen, and scratched his left whisker. I supposed it would be different to suddenly develop a wen for someone. Different and messier. He asked me about Ben Wade, hitherto merely mutely unemployed, and of course I said the right thing. `

**Italian text**:
A quel punto la ragazza aveva ormai lasciato Henry, grazie a Dio. Era palesemente spaventata. Non sembrava in grado di comprendere nemmeno per un attimo quei primi due omicidi compiuti da lui. Lui si comportava in maniera molto gentile. Aveva mandato via la zia del rettore, spiegò alla ragazza, come si scaccia una zanzara. Un tocco sconosciuto. Sì, ammazzare il tempo. Lo stavo facendo. Buffo come la mente lavorasse pigra; almeno all'apparenza. Forse l'eredità significava qualcosa. E valutai in quale direzione mi portasse. Un'enfasi, pensai, era una cosa terribile. Ma il tempo di ammazzare non sarebbe stato così bello.
Mi resi conto di essere impressionabile, e di apprezzare un buon omicidio. Ma vidi che lo Zotico, una volta sistemato, non aveva nulla di poetico. Si tormentava la basetta sinistra, sotto la quale aveva sviluppato un bi-torzolo, il che - immaginai - doveva essere ben diverso dallo sviluppare un bernoccolo per qualcuno o qual-cosa. Diverso e più problematico. Lui mi chiese della Ben Wade, sino ad allora semplicemente inutilizzata in silenzio, e ovviamente risposi nel modo corretto.

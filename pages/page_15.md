**Annotated text**:
```
Now, I considered, in my dear Lyons it would
be coming of age hours, and I wondered if they
would ever do that over here. I fancied what
self-consciousness and preciosity there would
be, for instance, if the B.B.C. ever took it up. A
strange institution ; but the nursed fuse was
always interesting. Yes, if sitting at the familiar
table with Bart chewing at my moccasins, I
could have broadcast it all, I would have left
the mighty heart of England to deal with it. On
that very day, I recalled, another terrible thing
happened. John Hewit and Sarah Drew, just
engaged to be married, were working together
in a field of barley when they were both struck
by lightning. Alexander, the only noteworthy
Pope of my native land, was demonstrably
affected. And my namesake wrote a letter, in
which he said that Sarah’s left eye was injured,
and there appeared a black spot on her breast.
Her lover was all over black ; but not the least
sign of life was found in either.

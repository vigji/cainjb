**Annotated text**:
`Now, I considered, in my dear Lyons it would be coming of age hours, and I wondered if they would ever do that over here.`

`I fancied what self-consciousness and preciosity there would be, for instance, if the B.B.C. ever took it up.`

`A strange institution ; but the nursed fuse was always interesting. Yes, if sitting at the familiar table with Bart chewing at my moccasins, I could have broadcast it all, I would have left the mighty heart of England to deal with it.`

`On that very day, I recalled, another terrible thing happened. John Hewit and Sarah Drew, just engaged to be married, were working together in a field of barley when they were both struck by lightning. Alexander, the only noteworthy Pope of my native land, was demonstrably affected. And my namesake wrote a letter, in which he said that Sarah’s left eye was injured, and there appeared a black spot on her breast. Her lover was all over black ; but not the least sign of life was found in either.`
[Alexander Pope, on two lovers struck by lightning; Stanton Harcourt in Oxfordshire Cotswolds; 31 July]

Now, I considered, in my dear Lyons it would
be coming of age hours, and I wondered if they
would ever do that over here. I fancied what
self-consciousness and preciosity there would
be, for instance, if the B.B.C. ever took it up. A
strange institution ; but the nursed fuse was
always interesting. Yes, if sitting at the familiar
table with Bart chewing at my moccasins, I
could have broadcast it all, I would have left
the mighty heart of England to deal with it. On
that very day, I recalled, another terrible thing
happened. John Hewit and Sarah Drew, just
engaged to be married, were working together
in a field of barley when they were both struck
by lightning. Alexander, the only noteworthy
Pope of my native land, was demonstrably
affected. And my namesake wrote a letter, in
which he said that Sarah’s left eye was injured,
and there appeared a black spot on her breast.
Her lover was all over black ; but not the least
sign of life was found in either.

**Italian text**:

Ora, valutai, nella mia cara Lione sarebbe stata l'ora della maggiore età, e mi chiesi se l'avrebbero mai fatto anche qui. Immaginai quale impaccio e preziosità ci sarebbero stati, per esempio, se la B.B.C. l'avesse mai imitata. Una strana istituzione; ma la prima notizia è sempre stata interessante. Sì, se sedendo al tavolo famigliare con Bart che mi mordeva i mocassini, avessi potuto mandare tutto in onda, avrei lasciato il possente cuore dell'Inghilterra ad affrontarlo. John Hewit e Sarah Drew, appena fidanzati, lavoravano insieme in un campo di orzo quando furono entrambi colpiti a morte da un fulmine. Alexander, l'unico papa degno di nota della mia terra natia, si dimostrò colpito. E colui che porta il mio nome scrisse una lettera nella quale diceva che l'occhio sinistro di Sarah era ferito e che aveva una macchia nera sul seno. Il suo amante era tutto nero ; ma nessuno dei due diede cenno di vita.

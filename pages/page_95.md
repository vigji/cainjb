`I knew, of course, that if I got there in five minutes I would have double the time for my by no means suburban hops at the Caf Royal, without insulting it and myself with John Montagus arrangement for an uninterrupted session at the gaming table. I felt so much at one with Holy Mr. Herbert. Or Mr. Haddock did he call himself? But he was right about these hours, and if that was not holiness, what was? Meed kissing laces, surely he had convulsed us with. For the moment it didnt matter. Because I had decided what to do. Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink, and then drew a sheet of notepaper towards me. I took up my pen, after having laid it down again and again, and, seeing that the ink was sufficient, plunged in. In clear terse phrase, utterly neglecting my contact with his infancy, I told him all, hour by hour, day by day, from the inception to the culmination of the horrid act.`

**Italian text**:
Certo, sapevo che, arrivando l à in cinque minuti, avrei avuto il doppio del tempo per fare un salto decisamente poco suburbano al Café Royal senza insultare quello e la mia persona con i preparativi di John Montagu per una sessione ininterrotta al tavolo da gioco. Mi sentivo tutt'uno con il Santo Mr. Herbert. Oppure si chiamava Mr. Haddock ? Ma aveva ragione a proposito delle ore e, se quella non era santità, cos'era ? Vogliono renderei la vita difficile, e ci stanno riuscendo. Perché io avevo deciso cosa fare. Leda ed Ebe, diedi da bere al mio cigno, poi presi un foglio di carta e lo tirai verso di me. Afferrai la penna e, dopo averla riappoggiata molte volte, vedendo che l'inchiostro era sufficiente, tuffai il pennino. Con un fraseggio chiaro e pulito, trascurando del tutto il mio contatto con la sua infanzia, gli dissi ogni cosa, ora dopo ora, giorno dopo giorno, dall'inizio al culmine dell'orrendo gesto.

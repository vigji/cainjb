fear from flame or steel, I sickeningly gathered, 
or poison doubtless ; but from water---feel. Go 
find the bottom! He was asking for it. Was he 
to be disappointed? Oh, yeah. A babbled o 
green fields (sorry, even in retrospect the habit

**Italian text**:

La vittima, perché adesso lo devo definire tale - sebbene con riluttanza -, bloccava tutta l'aria fresca proveniente dalla finestra. Allungò la mano e chiese se la morte fosse tanto diversa dal sonno quando giungeva in questo modo. Così pontificò. Va temuta la morte data dalle fiamme e dall'acciaio - compresi con disgusto - o senza dubbio dal veleno, ma dall'acqua...
senti. Va' a cercare il fondo! Lo esigeva. Sarebbe rimasto deluso? Oh, sì. Un non so che di verdi praterie (scusatemi, nemmeno con il senno del poi ho perso l'abitudine) che di certo non poteva aver visto bene.
Gli tirai su i calzini e lo sollevai verso l'esterno con tutta la mia forza. La finestra non era più buia. Lo sciocco, con un po di fortuna, era morto. Cosa aveva detto quando infine mi aveva lasciato? "Quale artista muore con me!" o qualcosa del genere. No, non mi diceva nulla. Ma, grazie al cielo, non ero un detective.

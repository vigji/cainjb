```
Naturally I looked up. And I tell you I found it 
awe-inspiring enough to actually see my own 
name through the window, printed there in 
great letters for the gaze of all and sundry. With 
a blush I concentrated again on Henry, and 
asked myself if his recent activities did or did 
not constitute the darbs. With a final flirt at 
the fringe, the other tapped and scattered the 
saintly ashes. Agriculture was to take back her 
own, it seemed, and I rejoiced to have my last 
night of the bent broad back. I couldnt think 
why I became suddenly aware of Yeats ; and 
then it came to me : we find heartedness among 
men that ride upon horses. It was here, of 
course, they commemorated Colonel Anthony 
every year. Good luck to him. Really I didnt 
like the children. A little he and she bounced 
in, half settling on my side like sparrows, and 
devirginating a bag of gum prunes as they 
bounced. How could I concentrate? And Henry 
was waiting for me.

**Italian text**:
Come è ovvio, sollevai lo sguardo. E vi assicuro che scoprii quanto mettesse soggezione vedere il mio stesso cognome al di là del vetro, scritto a lettere cubitali affinché tutti lo vedessero. Arrossendo, mi concentrai di nuovo su Henry e mi chiesi se le sue recenti attività fossero o meno eccellenti. Con un ultimo, rapido fremito della barba, l'altro diede un colpetto e disperse le sacre ceneri . A quanto sembrava, l'agricoltura si sarebbe ripresa il suo, ed esultai vedendo per l'ultima volta quella schiena ampia e curva. Non riuscii a capire come mai mi fosse venuto in mente Yeats ; poi compresi : troviamo la sincerità tra gli uomini che vanno a cavallo. Certo, da quelle parti commemoravano ogni anno il colonnello Anthony. Buona fortuna a lui. A me i bambini proprio non piacevano. Arrivarono a balzelloni un maschietto e una femminuccia, piazzandosi al mio fianco come passerotti e, mentre saltellavano, sverginavano un sacchetto di caramelle gommose alla prugna. Come potevo concentrarmi ? E Henry mi sta va aspettando.

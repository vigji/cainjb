**Annotated text**:
`It was a petty employ for one of my reputation ; you would not hear, I felt, much more of it. I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.`

`I have spoken of ironic comment. There was, I thought, little chance of that. I wondered if he had ever been an innocent child feeding among the pantries. But that was no fit time for such musings. He took foolish occasion to tell me who he was; as if I did not know.`

`Bills should always be met squarely.` Bill

`I turned to the man, and his gaze soon fell before mine. He had always spoken as if his throat were full of jelly. Now with a leer, he emitted sounds through this quag which shaped themselves into hints at some perpetual reward for valuable services rendered.`

`But even then I had not made up my mind. It was, I said to myself, a bad workman who could not play one tool against another.`  "a bad workman quarrels with his tools", idiom

It was a petty employ for one of my reputation ; 
you would not hear, I felt, much more of it. I

spoken of ironic comment. There was, I

who he was ; as if I did not know. Bills should 
always be met squarely. I turned to the man, 
and his gaze soon fell before mine. He had 
always spoken as if his throat were full of jelly. 
Now with a leer, he emitted sounds through

**Italian text**:

Era un'attività insignificante per una persona della mia reputazione; non ne avreste più sentito parlare mol-to, temo. Spero che non conduciate una doppia vita, pretendendo di essere uno scavezzacollo mentre siete invece un fiore di virtù. Sarebbe una vera ipocrisia. Ho parlato di commento ironico. C'era, pensai, poca possibilità di farne. Mi chiesi se lui fosse mai stato un bambino innocente che si nutriva dalle dispense. Ma non era il momento adatto a simili riflessioni. Colse la sciocca occasione di dirmi chi fosse; come se non lo sapessi. 1 debiti andrebbero sempre onorati onestamente, e gente come Bill sempre affrontata direttamente. Mi voltai verso l'uomo e il suo sguardo si abbassò ben presto davanti al mio. Aveva sempre parlato come se avesse la gola piena di gelatina. E allora, con uno sguardo mali-gno, attraverso quel pantano emise suoni che presero la forma di accenni a qualche ricompensa perpetua per preziosi servizi resi. Ma ancora non avevo preso una decisione. Lui, mi dissi, era un pessimo operaio che non era in grado di battere un attrezzo contro un altro.

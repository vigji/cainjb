**Annotated text**:
`This is good. She accepts Lovers Delight from me. She has spoken very little ; but she urges me to make trial of a Banana Split. Is there some esoteric meaning behind the titles? Now Ecky passes over to the Dawn. Alexanders my name. They cad me Ecky when I was a boy. Eh, Ecky! Yere a awfu old man. Emotional stuff. Anyway Ecky has disappeared in the Dawn. I almost wish I took it. The hard stuff, I mean ; but it would ruin my hand. Where would my income be if Aquarius were to turn Gemini? She tells me a lot, each word huskily lisping over that round petulant vermilion lower lip, of a doctor friend of hers. I have only known her a few minutes ; but I hate to think she would change---her voice hits a pocket, just like a plane, when she talks of him---an honest station between Kings Cross and Edinburgh for---what is it?---beings drone pipe, whose nostril turns to blight the strivelled stars and thicks the lusty breathing of the sun.`

**Italian text**:

Questo è positivo. Lei accetta il Lover's Delight che le offro. Ha parlato molto poco ; ma mi invita a provare il Banana Split. C'è qualche significato esoterico dietro quei nomi ? Adesso passa Ecky per recarsi al Dawn. Mi chiamo Alexander. Da ragazzo mi chiamavano Ecky. Eh, Ecky! Sei un orribile vecchio. Pesanti faccende emotive. In ogni caso Ecky è sparito dentro il Dawn. Quasi quasi vorrei averla presa . Intendo dire la roba pesante ; ma mi rovinerebbe la mano. Da dove verrebbe il mio introito se Aquarius dovesse trasformarsi in Gemini ? Lei mi parla molto - e ogni parola esce farfugliando roca da quel labbro inferiore arrotondato, imbronciato e rosso vermiglio - di un suo amico medico. La conosco solo da pochi minuti ; ma odio pensare che cambierebbe - la sua voce trema quando parla di lui - una stazione, o forse una condizione, onesta tra King's Cross e Edimburgo con - cos'è ? - la canna di bordone dell'essere la cui narice si gira a guastare le stelle ormai essiccate e addensa il vigoroso respiro del sole.

**Annotated text**:
`Of course I was sorry to say good-bye to old Medehamstede ; but it was pleasant to sit down and to really find myself alone at last. Those emotional times were trying to us all. I felt that my lips were paler than I liked ; but a touch of Pasquiers claret soon put me right. Dear old Pasquier, I had come across him in Paris, at that little place in the Rue de la Harpe, a street in which, I have been told, there was a touch of orderly room even in the disorderly houses. I opened a magazine and looked hastily through the last paragraphs of the short stories. I was all for love ; but fading out on an embrace never appealed to me. The embrace in my short stories---and my life was all short stories, I had come to think---occurred in the first few words. And afterwards the plot. The complete novel length looked better. It was called Savage Conqueror, and I liked that.`

**Italian text**:

Certo, mi dispiaceva dire addio alla vecchia Mede-hamstede ; ma era piacevole ritrovarmi finalmente a sedere senza nessuno intorno. Quei tempi carichi di emozione erano difficili per noi tutti. Avevo la sensazione che le mie labbra fossero più esangui di quanto avrei gradito; ma un tocco del Bordeaux di Pasquier sistemò tutto. Caro, vecchio Pasquier, ci eravamo incontrati per caso a Parigi, in quel posticino di Rue de la Harpe, una via dove, mi dicono, c'era un tocco di stanze ordinate anche nelle case in disordine. Aprii una rivista e scorsi in fretta gli ultimi paragrafi dei racconti brevi. Ero più che favorevole all'amore, cer-to; ma non mi era mai piaciuto dire addio con un abbraccio. Nelle mie storie brevi - e la mia vita era fatta di storie brevi, a ben pensarci - l'abbraccio era racchiuso nelle prime parole. Poi c'era la trama. In tutta la sua lunghezza, il romanzo sembrava promettente.
Si chiamava Conquistatore selvaggio, e mi piaceva.

```
I see that old dandy has purchased Cape 
Jasmine. Your gardenia is difficult at a distance 
to determine. It may be florida flore-pleno, 
double white. Why should I care? I am a very 
sick fellow. Gardenias! And there are also 
Gardeners Garters, Phalaris arundinacea 
variegata. I am not at all well. He is clutched 
unwillingly into greeting old Mrs. Cave, our 
local Dame Quickly. They mince at one 
another. Yes, by James! James? Lo, how these 
fair immaculate women walk behind their 
jocund maker ; and we see slighted De Mauves, 
and that far different she, Gressie, the trivial 
Sphinx. We commiserate pass into the night 
from the loud banquet. Sorry. She urges me to 
the American mess. I wolf three-quarters, 
thinking of Quebec. Then I try her out, saying, 
with an airy lift of the spoon, this savours not 
of death, this hath a relish of eternity. 
Excellent, my dear Watson. But the leopards 
eyes do not bat a blink. Can she be guilty?

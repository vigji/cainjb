**Annotated text**:
`It was when that half Pole, half Frenchman, and usually up the first half, that self-styled drunken mongrel and lazy waster, got normally out of bed.` Another quote from the Typhoon. "half  Pole,  half  Frenchman, drunken  mongrel, lazy waster, and the rest of it — "

`I remembered that when Hlne told him of her attachment he gave up brandy. And took to absinthe. It was one of the times that he had an absinthe. They said that it made the heart grow fonder. What had I actually seen? I had seen Henry---surely I had heard him called so---bending innocently over an innocent corpse of his own making. And I had also seen the doctor leading the old man up the garden, not once or twice, but many times. The girl was no longer there. I stayed myself with devilled Epicam and Royans aux Achard, levered into me with Peter Barleys and washed down and out, foul thought, with Villacabras. But one was so helpless alone in a great building of many flats : I was glad I had not given up stealing at the doors.`

**Italian text**:
Era l'ora in cui quel mezzo polacco, mezzo francese, e di solito la prima metà, quel sedicente bastardo ubriaco e pigro buono a nulla, si alzava dal letto. Rammentai che, quando Hélène gli disse del suo affetto, lui aveva rinunciato al brandy. E aveva cominciato con l'assenzio. Era uno dei momenti in cui si assentava con l'assenzio. Dicevano che scaldasse il cuore. Che cosa avevo visto realmente? Avevo visto Henry - di sicuro lo avevo
sentito chiamare così - chinarsi in maniera innocente su un cadavere innocente che era opera sua. E avevo anche visto il medico che accompagnava il vecchio in giardino, non una o due volte, ma molte. La ragazza non era più lì. Mi ri focillai con carne in scatola e sottaceti che inghiottii con dei cracker e lavai via, che brutta idea, con del Villacabras. Ma ci si sentiva inermi in un grande edificio con tanti appartamenti : mi rallegrai di non aver rinunciato a osservare furtivamente le porte.

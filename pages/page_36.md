**Annotated text**:
`Strange that old Calabar, as I called him, should fail me ; yet on the morning after I had introduced him to the person most concerned, I felt certain that I could not rely on him. I felt certain that I could not rely on him. I would give him another day, and then. . . . It was distinctly awkward in a way. At eleven in the forenoon little Mavis Kitchener came with a gift of eggs, a clutch of eggs, I might say, looking at her determined little fists. Distinctly awkward : for, knowing they were bound to be bad, I spent an hour I could ill afford in finding her an equivalent in wormy raspberries. How could I marry her in the circumstances? Your good uncle, whom you count the father of your fortune, longed for this alliance. I remembered, as I wandered among the abortive Bengal attempts of the rhododendrons, that she whose bidding I then did would always make up. Henry was always made up too. He had buried the corpse; only the eyes showed.`

**Italian text**:

Strano che il vecchio Calabar, come lo chiamavo, abbia tradito le mie aspettative; eppure, la mattina dopo averlo presentato a chi di dovere, ebbi la certezza di non poter contare su di lui. Gli avrei concesso un altro giorno, poi... Era decisamente strano sotto un certo aspetto. Alle undici del mattino giunse la piccola Ma-
vis Kitchener portando delle uova in dono, una nidiata di uova potrei definirla osservando i suoi piccoli pugni risoluti. Decisamente strano : perch√©, sapendo che sarebbero state guaste, trascorsi un'ora che non avrei potuto permettermi per trovarle un equivalente in lamponi zeppi di vermi. Come avrei potuto sposarla in quelle circostanze? Il tuo bravo zio, al quale attribuisci il ruolo di padre della tua fortuna, desiderava ardentemente questa unione. Mentre vagavo tra i falliti tentativi dei rododendri bengalesi, rammentai che colei della quale eseguivo gli ordini ci riusciva sempre. Anche Henry ce la faceva sempre. Aveva seppellito il cadavere ; si vedevano solo gli occhi.

After I might just as easily have been a literary 
bloke, like Jeremy Taylor or Eugene Sue. I told 
myself that all art was one. There might be 
superficial differences in their work, but they 
had, in the words of the old song, gone the 
same way home. When was it? Why, to-day, if I 
mistook not. I felt I must take a grip of my 
failing, in so far, that was, as it distorted the 
time factor. But in that case I knew I was right. 
To think of time---of all that retrospection, to 
think of to-day, and the ages continued 
henceforward. Have you guessed you yourself 
would not continue? Have you dreaded these 
earth beetles? But it occurred to me that to 
think of time with my delight would have got 
him guessing. I woke to the consciousness that I 
had done very little in my life. Not Dolittle but 
Didlittle. What was a did little? Didling, 
perhaps, or didlet. It was at the former that I 
woke to consciousness that morning.

**Italian text**:

In fondo avrei potuto essere altrettanto facilmente un tipo letterario, come Jeremy Taylor o Eugène Sue. Mi dissi che tutte le arti erano uguali. Nelle loro opere possono esserci differenze insignificanti ma, per dirlo con le parole della vecchia canzone, sono morti allo stesso modo. Quando era successo? Be', proprio oggi, se non m'ingannavo. Decisi di dover affrontare il mio fallimento, in quanto, cioè, distorceva il fattore temporale. Ma in quel caso sapevo di aver ragione. Pensare al tempo - a tutto quel passato dietro a noi, pensare all'oggi, e alle età che continuano, d'ora in poi. Vi ha colto il sospetto che proprio voi non sareste continuati?
Vi ha preso il terrore di quegli scarabei che frugan nella terra? Ma mi sovvenne che pensare al tempo con mio diletto gli avrebbe messo una pulce nell'orecchio. Mi svegliai con la consapevolezza di aver fatto ben poco nella vita. Non è proprio che faccio poco, ma che facevo poco. Che cos'era fare poco? Buttare via il tempo, forse, oppure prendersi più tempo del dovuto. Ma fu con la prima sensazione che mi risvegliai quel mattino.

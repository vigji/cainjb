**Notes**:


**Annotated text**:
And I really think I would have preferred the
Maestro Jimson’s title, now that this piled
abomination is actually before me. But the
queen can do no wrong. The rain that came
heavily is drying off lightly. There, jauntily
tripping from the edge of one puddle to
another is crisp Sir Roland Mowthalorn,
shuddering old thing, intent to buy the day’s
buttonhole from gin-faced Annie behind the
church. I remember clearly, perhaps because I
ought to have my wits about me for another
purpose, how Sir Roland’s father, Sir Weedon,
once saw Henry taking the part of Lesurques
and mixed him up with Le Cirque d’Hiver.
Instead of really explaining, she points me gaily
to a little boy about, she says, to tumble into
the sea. Perhaps he has already tumbled in. In
the snowy cumulus above the orange there
seems to be now a hole. She tells me to mash all
with a spoon. If she had said a mashie. But she
is so beautiful. Can I suspect her?

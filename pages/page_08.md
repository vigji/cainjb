Could I be developing a green-eyed streak? I
investigated the body before me with the aid of
a powerful glass. At least I always thought of it
as powerful, because I never could quite
understand how it worked. I knew I ought to
have the body as long as possible. At last I was
satisfied. I measured the distance carefully with
my eye : a good forty inches, I made it. I
gathered from his talk that Guido looked his
last to-day on the sausage place---furtively I
knew how excellent---and that Kilmarnock and
Belmerino completely lost their heads. But
whether or not this was cause and effect I
couldn’t make out. I wished for the hundredth
time I had a better brain. Later she was wearing
the same bow---I loathed bows myself---and
that time he found them and trimmed the left
end. Then he turned what he was holding a bit ;
so that it pushed its way right through. Then he
twiddled the black knobby thing, and Mr. Hall
burst in upon us. The knobby thing was black
and red.

**Italian text**:

Stavo forse sviluppando un sentimento di invidia? Esaminai il corpo che avevo davanti con una lente potente.
O, almeno, l'avevo sempre creduta potente perché non avevo mai capito bene come funzionasse. Sapevo che avrei dovuto avere il corpo più lungo possibile. Una soddisfazione, finalmente. Misurai attentamente la distanza con gli occhi; quaranta pollici abbondanti, ce l'avevo fatta. Dai suoi discorsi compresi che oggi Guido aveva chiuso gli occhi nel posto della mortadella - segretamente sapevo che era ottima - e che Kilmarnock e Balmerino avevano perso completamente la testa. Ma non capivo se si trattasse di causa ed effetto. Desiderai per la centesima volta di avere un cervello migliore.
Più tardi lei indossava lo stesso fiocco - personalmente detestavo i fiocchi - e questa volta lui le trovò e spuntò il capo sinistro. Poi, girando appena ciò che teneva in mano, trapassò. Quindi ruotò leggermente una piccola cosa nera e rotonda e la voce del signor Hall irruppe nella stanza. La cosa rotonda era nera e rossa.

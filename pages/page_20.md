`The best I had done seemed to me blank and suspicious, my great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? Next day I would have to pay for all I had had of solace, and for all I would have later. It would, I thought, have seemed impossible to link Will’s friend Ben with Will’s wife, and yet they went off together, or at least on that same day : the bricklayer out of Annandale and the inheritor of the second-best bed : strange bedfellows. Underneath this stone, he had said, doth lie as much Beauty as could die ; but of course he hadn’t been talking about her. Nor had either had anything to do with my waking, my strong tea, and my first pill.`

`That all happened by the Mole, and there was the oldest brass in England, saying : SIRE : IOHAN : DAUBERNOUN : CHIVALER : GIST : ICY : DEV : DE : SA : ALME : EYT : MERCY.`  Sire: Iohan Daubernoun : Chivaler : Gist : Icy : Dev De: Sa : Alme : Eyt : Mercy.

`Good enough. We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we two.`

The best I had done seemed to me blank and
suspicious, my great thoughts as I supposed
them, were they not in reality meagre? Next
day I would have to pay for all I had had of
solace, and for all I would have later. It would, I
thought, have seemed impossible to link Will’s
friend Ben with Will’s wife, and yet they went
off together, or at least on that same day : the
bricklayer out of Annandale and the inheritor
of the second-best bed : strange bedfellows.
Underneath this stone, he had said, doth lie as
much Beauty as could die ; but of course he
hadn’t been talking about her. Nor had either
had anything to do with my waking, my strong
tea, and my first pill. That all happened by the
Mole, and there was the oldest brass in
England, saying : SIRE : IOHAN :
DAUBERNOUN : CHIVALER : GIST : ICY :
DEV : DE : SA : ALME : EYT : MERCY. Good
enough. We have circled and circled till we
have arrived home again, we two.

**Italian text**:
Le cose migliori che avevo fatto mi sembravano vacue e sospette, che i miei grandi pensieri, come io li immagi-navo, fossero in realtà miseri? Il giorno seguente avrei dovuto pagare per tutto il conforto che avevo ricevuto, e per tutto quello che avrei avuto in seguito. Sarebbe sembrato impossibile, pensai, collegare Ben, l'amico di Will, alla moglie di Will, eppure se ne andarono insie-me, o almeno lo fecero nello stesso giorno : il muratore di Annandale e l'erede del secondo miglior letto : strani compagni. Sotto questa pietra, aveva detto, giace quan-ta bellezza potrebbe morire; naturalmente non stava parlando di lei. E nessuno dei due ebbe nulla a che ve-dere con il mio risveglio, il mio tè forte e la mia prima pillola. Tutto questo accadde presso il Mole, e c'era la più vecchia targa funeraria d'ottone d'Inghilterra che diceva : SIRE: IOHAN: DAUBERNOUN : CHIVALER : GIST : ICY : DEV : DE : SA : ALME : EYT : MERCY. Bene. Abbiamo continuato a girare in tondo fino all'arrivo a casa, noi due.

**Annotated text**:
`The picture of the Old Mill at Bramley, with its medlar tree overhanging the water, its octagonal brick dovecot, and its sweet water grape vine, had not detained me the day before. I had groped for my first cigarette of the day, eyes hardly open, a few miles on. So easily were things forgotten! I found it difficult to realise that to-day had once been an English holiday, like that other fifth, and for much the same reason. James had got off, the Earl and his brother Alexander had emphatically not. But the whole thing was not clear to me, and I doubted if it was to anyone. The two smells, of the medlar and the vine, had been the two notes of a chord, venetian red and peridot, that bit one ear gently and the other hard---or did I mean loud and tenuous?---a monotone save for this variation : once it had been hard, gentle, hard, hard, gentle, gentle, gentle hard. It had been a pretty smell.`

**Italian text**:
L'immagine del vecchio mulino di Bramley, con i l nespolo
che sporge sull'acqua, il suo colombaia ottagonale
di mattoni, la sua dolce vite, non mi aveva trattenuto
il giorno precedente. Avevo cercato a tentoni l a
prima sigaretta della giornata, con gli occhi non ancora
del tutto aperti, dopo qualche miglio. Come si dimenticavano
facilmente le cose! Mi resi conto con difficoltà
che oggi era stato un giorno di vacanza in Inghilterra,
come l'altro cinque, e più o meno per lo stesso
motivo. James se n'era andato, il Conte e suo fratello
Alexander decisamente no. Ma tutta la faccenda non
mi era chiara e dubitavo che lo fosse per qualcuno. I
due odori, quello del nespolo e quello della vite, erano
stati le due note di un accordo, rosso veneziano e
peridoto, che mordevano un orecchio con delicatezza
e l'altro con forza - oppure intendevo dire penetrante
e lieve? -, un monotono, se non fosse per questa variazione
: un tempo era stato duro, dolce, duro, duro,
dolce, dolce, dolce duro. Era stato un odore gradevole.

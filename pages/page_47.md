**Notes**:


**Annotated text**:
`Babs now moves across the vision, crowned with two straight downfalls, as it were, of copper upon her head. The uncurling flow is to right and left, as if a river, reflecting a thunder sunset, had split in terror into twin cataracts.`

`And here, thank heaven, come the first, much needed rain of the week. A greyness and a spray to begin with, and suddenly a birth of little silver frogs all along the road.`

`We were sitting in the verandah in the dead, hot, close air, gasping and praying that the black-blue clouds would let down and bring the cool. I always think of that, even in England.`

`But, looking across at the figure opposite me, I realise that it is actually she and not Babs that has got me. Got me, that is a terrible conjunction of two little words ; Henry does not like it at all.` 

`But as a proof that what I say is true, she is strong enough to wean me from my thoughts of Orange Pekoe to a Special Orange Supreme.`

Babs now moves across the vision, crowned 
with two straight downfalls, as it were, of 
copper upon her head. The uncurling flow is to 
right and left, as if a river, reflecting a thunder 
sunset, had split in terror into twin cataracts. 
And here, thank heaven, come the first, much 
needed rain of the week. A greyness and a spray 
to begin with, and suddenly a birth of little 
silver frogs all along the road. We were sitting 
in the verandah in the dead, hot, close air, 
gasping and praying that the black-blue clouds 
would let down and bring the cool. I always 
think of that, even in England. But, looking 
across at the figure opposite me, I realise that it 
is actually she and not Babs that has got me. 
Got me, that is a terrible conjunction of two 
little words ; Henry does not like it at all. But 
as a proof that what I say is true, she is strong 
enough to wean me from my thoughts of 
Orange Pekoe to a Special Orange Supreme.

**Italian text**:

Babs si muove ora attraverso la visione, incoronata, per così dire, da due cascate di rame sulla testa. I ricci ricadono sciogliendosi a destra e a sinistra, come se un fiume sul quale si specchia un tramonto tempestoso si fosse separato, nel terrore, in due diverse cateratte. Ed ecco che, grazie al cielo, arriva la prima, tanto attesa pioggia della settimana. Comincia con il grigiore e una spruzzata, e all'improvviso nascono piccoli rospi argentati lungo la strada. Eravamo seduti in veranda nell'aria morta, rovente, chiusa, annaspando e pregando che le nuvole di un nero bluastro si aprissero portando il fresco. Ci penso sempre, anche in Inghilterra. Ma, osservando la figura che ho di fronte, mi rendo conto che è lei, e non Babs, che mi ha colpito. Mi ha colpito, terribile unione di tre parole; a Henry non piace affat-to. Ma, a dimostrare che ciò che dico è vero, lei è abbastanza forte da distogliere i miei pensieri dall'Orange Pekoe per portarli verso uno Special Orange Supreme.

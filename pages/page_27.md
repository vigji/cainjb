**Annotated text**:
`I had seen, day after day, every sunlit or night obscured detail of the funny old house I had visited so many years ago`

` Through it, handsome, cadaverous and so quiet, had walked Death himself, tapping unnoticed at the very walls of the mansions of life ; trying here, failing there, lightly fingering for the sign of a breach. A tiny opening. Apparently the person who slept in the lock-up at that county town on the Severn, or perhaps woke, would hear this time.` The county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester lie on its course.

`I had found that I could face my usual mixture of Peaberry Mysore and Blue Mountain. I had made certain havoc of two on toast, their silver skins laced with their golden blood.`  Peaberry Mysore and Blue Mountain sound like coffee, but? Toast?

`To think of the tiny Clem mixed up, nay, a prime mover, in such affairs.`   Clement?

`Useful, courteous little chip of a bat. He had hushed my brat for me when he was only six, one morning on which I had wanted to go out for a walk.`

I had seen, day after day, every sunlit or night 
obscured detail of the funny old house I had 
visited so many years ago. Through it, 
handsome, cadaverous and so quiet, had walked 
Death himself, tapping unnoticed at the very 
walls of the mansions of life ; trying here, 
failing there, lightly fingering for the sign of a 
breach. A tiny opening. Apparently the person 
who slept in the lock-up at that county town 
on the Severn, or perhaps woke, would hear 
this time. I had found that I could face my 
usual mixture of Peaberry Mysore and Blue 
Mountain. I had made certain havoc of two on 
toast, their silver skins laced with their golden 
blood. To think of the tiny Clem mixed up, nay, 
a prime mover, in such affairs. Useful, 
courteous little chip of a bat. He had hushed 
my brat for me when he was only six, one 
morning on which I had wanted to go out for a 
walk.

**Italian text**:

Giorno dopo giorno avevo visto ogni particolare della buffa, vecchia casa che avevo visitato tanti anni prima, illuminata dal sole oppure oscurata dalla notte. Ed era stata attraversata da Morte in persona: bello, cadaverico e silenzioso, che bussava inosservato alle pareti delle case della vita; provando qui, fallendo lì, cercando con dita lievi i segni di una breccia, di una minuscola apertura. A quanto sembrava, la persona che dormiva nella gattabuia di quella città di campagna sul Severn, o che forse si era svegliata, questa volta avrebbe senti-to. Avevo scoperto di poter affrontare la mia consueta miscela di Peaberry Mysore e Blue Mountain! Avevo fatto un certo guazzabuglio di quei due sul pane tosta-to, della loro pelle argentea mescolata al sangue dora-to. E pensare che il minuscolo Clem era immischiato, o, meglio, era il movente di quelle faccende. Utile, cor-tese, piccolo frammento di intrigante. Quando aveva solo sei anni, mi aveva spazzolato il cappello una mattina in cui io volevo andare a fare una passeggiata.

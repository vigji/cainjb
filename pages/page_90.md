**Annotated text**:
`While my mind had been thus far away, a grotesque looking old gentleman had fluttered like a bat to the seat between us, and now deposited, with the bitter sang-froid of the unworldly, a dilapidated deer-stalker of pinkish tweed upon the glacial parquet.`

`I thought I knew the type : learned in a macabre way, even distinguished ; one who was rich enough to remain unspotted by convention, and who yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force, gold of course, for the undoing of a materialistic world.`

`Gathering a fungus in the other golden ruin before me, I considered within myself what such an obvious hermit could be doing among the brilliant lights of this notoriously soign place.`

`A dog was patently sorrowing in the distance. The two had their heads close together. The poor brutes howling bothered me, and I was glad when it ceased.`

`You will, Oscar, you will. Whistlers jibe I had always taken personally. Was all my endeavour to be in the future? Would I never do anything in the present? It all seemed so fatuous.`

While my mind had been thus far away, a 
grotesque looking old gentleman had fluttered 
like a bat to the seat between us, and now 
deposited, with the bitter sang-froid of the 
unworldly, a dilapidated deer-stalker of pinkish 
tweed upon the glacial parquet. I thought I 
knew the type : learned in a macabre way, even 
distinguished ; one who was rich enough to 
remain unspotted by convention, and who yet 
reserved a thousand chariots in full force, gold 
of course, for the undoing of a materialistic 
world. Gathering a fungus in the other golden 
ruin before me, I considered within myself 
what such an obvious hermit could be doing 
among the brilliant lights of this notoriously 
soign place. A dog was patently sorrowing in 
the distance. The two had their heads close 
together. The poor brutes howling bothered 
me, and I was glad when it ceased. You will, 
Oscar, you will. Whistlers jibe I had always 
taken personally. Was all my endeavour to be in 
the future? Would I never do anything in the 
present? It all seemed so fatuous.

**Italian text**:

Mentre la mia testa era persa in quei lontani pensieri,
un vecchio gentiluomo dall'aspetto grottesco era arrivato
svolazzando come un pipistrello per sedersi tra
noi, e in quel momento appoggiò, con l'amaro sangue
freddo di chi non è di questo mondo, un deer-stalker
malandato di tweed rosa sul gelido parquet. Credetti
di riconoscere il tipo : istruito in maniera macabra,
persino distinto ; ricco a sufficienza da non farsi condizionare
dalle convenzioni, ma ciononostante prenota
mille carri al gran completo, naturalmente d'oro, per la
rovina del mondo materialista. Raccogliendo un fungo
dalla rovina dorata che avevo davanti, valutai tra me e
me cosa mai potesse fare un eremita così manifesto tra
le luci brillanti di questo luogo notoriamente soigné. Un
cane, in lontananza, era palesemente triste. I due parlavano
fitto fitto, le teste vicine. Gli ululati di quel povero
bruto mi preoccupavano, e mi rallegrai quando cessarono.
Lo dirai, Oscar, lo dirai . Avevo sempre preso sul
personale lo scherno di Whistler. Tutte le mie imprese
si sarebbero realizzate in futuro ? Non avrei mai concluso
nulla nel presente ? Sembrava tutto molto fatuo.

**Annotated text**:
`It was just when the girl from the Asolo silk mills contended that morning was. There was something, I reflected, about the fashion, beastly, in the awful and literal sense of the word, as of equals, in which youth treated the young day. Heaven knew I would have been in bed, had not my head been surcharged with too perilous a stuff for sleep. I spent those six hours in an agony of recapitulation. Even as a tiny toddler, at old Mrs. Larkins school, when I was technically a mixed infant, I had shown signs of possessing these uncanny powers. In fact Mrs. Larkin might have called me Clare, so both voyant and audient was I. For a long time I sat and mused, looking into vacancy across the table. Gradually a realisation came to me that I would revisualise more connectedly on an assuaged stomach. I hoped for breakfast soon, nor was I to be disappointed. There was that silly girl of mine bursting into pang in the sausage, just like Pippa, as she always did.`

**Italian text**:
Il mattino giunse solo quando lo disse la ragazza del
setificio di Asolo. C'era qualcosa, riflettei, di bestiale
- tanto nel senso terribile quanto in quello letterale
del termine - nel modo in cui i giovani trattano l'alba.
Il Cielo mi è testimone : la sola ragione che mi ha fatto
alzare dal letto è stato il sovraccarico di cose troppo
pericolose per dormire. Trascorsi quelle sei ore in
un'angoscia di ricapitolazione . Già durante l'infanzia,
alla scuola della vecchia signora Larkin, quando ero
tecnicamente di etnia mista, avevo mostrato di avere
quei poteri fuori dal comune. In effetti la signora
Larkin avrebbe potuto chiamarmi Chiara, dato che
ero già veggente e udente . Sedetti a riflettere a lungo,
fissando il vuoto al di là del tavolo. A poco a poco
ebbi una presa di coscienza che avrei riesaminato in
maniera più coerente a stomaco pieno. Sperai che la
colazione arrivasse in fretta, e così fu. C'era quella mia
sciocca ragazza che aveva crampi allo stomaco per la
salsiccia, proprio come Pippa, come faceva sempre.
